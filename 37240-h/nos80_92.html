<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> man there is a
natural love of change and variety: the mind is wearied by continual
succession of similar objects, those pleasures which at first were
capable of inspiring emotions of delight; which once filled the heart
with rapture and enthusiasm; as they become familiar, fade by degrees,
they lose their brilliancy, the charm of novelty is gone, and soon they
please no more. The sublimer works of nature, which have roused the
attention of the traveller, excite not similar sensations in the bosoms
of those who have been long acquainted with their beauties: the lofty
mountain “with its robe of mist,” the stupenduous cliff that overlooks
the torrent, and the loud sounding waters of the tremendous cataract,
neither strike them with veneration nor with awe. Their eyes wander with
languor and indifference, over those scenes in which nature has been
most lavish of its beauties. The mind is attracted by diversity, we
follow with avidity any object which appears fascinating and pleasing,
until some fresh pursuit which fancy has furnished with superior charms
captivates the imagination. This love of variety is predominant in the
breast of every individual, it alike exists in the lowly cottage and the
splendid palace, in the circles of business and in the vortex of
pleasure, in the obscure paths of folly and ignorance, and in the
exalted walks of literature and science: and although those objects
which at a distance appeared dazling and beautiful, may lose their
brightness on a nearer approach, still the acquirements which have cost
us much labor and pain, have something in them peculiarly grateful. Man
has ever been considered as a fickle and inconstant being, rarely
content with his present situation, but continually looking out for
brighter and fairer prospects. This restlessness of the human mind has
been considered by some rigid moralists, as a source of trouble and
vexation to those who are under its influence,
<span class = "pagenum">217b</span>
but it is also a source of our greatest enjoyments: cold must be that
heart, which is insensible to all the charms of variety, and but little
calculated to partake of present joys, or to anticipate the more sublime
and exalted pleasures which are hid behind the impenetrable veil of
futurity.</p>

<h4><span class = "extended">JUSTICE</span>.</h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">Justice</span> may be defined that virtue
which impels us to give to every person what is his due. In this
extended sense of the word, it comprehends the practice of every virtue
which reason prescribes, or society should expect. Our duty to our
Maker, to each other, and to ourselves, are fully answered, if we give
them what we owe them. Thus justice, properly speaking, is the only
virtue, and all the rest have their origin in&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The qualities of candour, fortitude, charity, and generosity, for
instance, are not in their own nature virtues: and, if ever they deserve
the title, it is owing only to justice, which impels and directs them.
Without such a moderator, candour might become indiscretion, fortitude
obstinacy, charity imprudence, and generosity mistaken profusion.</p>

men capable of filling all the requisite duties of authority; but she is
a niggard in the birth of an exalted mind, scarcely producing in a
century a single genius to bless and enlighten a degenerate age.
Prodigal in the production of kings, governors, mandarines, chams, and
courtiers, she seems to have forgotten, for more than three thousand

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Alumbrado</span> was of the
same opinion, our advice was however neglected, for the next morning
when I went to see the Duke, I&nbsp;found the Count had already been
liberated. The matter happened in the following manner:</p>

<p>The Duke had paid him one more visit at night, in order to get some
explanation of Amelia’s history, asking the Count whether his account of
Amelia’s adventures had been strictly true, or intermixed with fiction?
The Count confessed frankly that he had not been very conscientious in
his relation, but had added to his picture many fictitious strokes; nay,
that he had disfigured even the principal incidents by interpolation, in
order to encrease by his adventrous tale, the Duke’s propensity to
wonderful incidents, and thus to render Amelia more interesting to him.
The Duke asked him how he could have risked a fraud which the first
meeting with the Countess could have laid open to him. “I&nbsp;was well
aware,” the Count replied, “that you as well as Amelia would be prompted
by the tender harmony which made your hearts beat in unison, to avoid
speaking of incidents which would have introduced Amelia’s late Lord and
her love for him.” The Duke asked him whether the Irishman had not acted
in concert with Lady Delier? “Only as far as he made use of her to
direct the love that had taken place between your Grace and Amelia,” the
Count answered; “the conditions and reflections under which the Baroness
was to assist in forwarding your mutual union are unknown to me.” The
Count being asked, whether that wonderful note by which Amelia had been
released from her vow of eternal fidelity to her deceased Lord, had been
a contrivance of Hiermanfor’s natural skill, or the effect of
supernatural power; the Count replied, the latter had been the case. The
Duke had been affected so much by the repeated mention of his Amelia,
that he began to melt in tears. The Count thought this state of mind
very propitious for regaining his liberty, and obtained it without
difficulty. What could the Duke have refused in that situation to
Amelia’s brother-in-law?</p>

<p>Alumbrado seemed to be not less displeased with this event than
myself. My hope that the Count would entirely destroy, by an ample
discovery of the juggling tricks of the Irishman, the Duke’s belief in
the supernatural skill of the latter was now utterly destroyed, for he
had not unfolded the most important mystery; the apparition of Antonio
at the church-yard. Yet I derived some consolation from the papers of
Clairval, which were still in the hands of the Duke, and proposed to
throw some light on that extraordinary incident. My friend himself
seemed to entertain the same hope, and although the papers had been
partly consumed by the fire, yet he was not discouraged, and undertook
the laborious task of
<span class = "pagenum">218b</span>
decyphering them. We retired lest we should disturb him.</p>

<p>The next morning Alumbrado came to my palace, informing me that he
went to pay a visit to the Duke, but had not been admitted. We concluded
from this, that he had not yet finished decyphering of the papers.</p>

<p>The Duke joined us about an hour after with gloomy looks, he gave me
some writings and said, “that is all that I could make out; read it and
edify yourself.”<span class = "locked">---</span></p>

<p>I began to read aloud, “Beloved and trusty---” the Duke interrupted
me&mdash;“It is a letter to Hiermanfor, written by the Lady of the late
Duke of <span class = "locked">B&mdash;&mdash;a</span>, at a time when
he had little hope of ascending the royal throne of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l</span>.”</p>

<p>“Beloved and trusty! I have read all your letters to our Privy
Secretary, along with the note by which you acquaint him with your
intention of introducing Miguel to the Hermit. I&nbsp;always read your
letters with admiration, yet I cannot but confess that I have great
reason to suspect you have it more at heart to be admired, than to gain
Miguel over to our party. I&nbsp;should think Miguel could have been
secured to us in a safer, easier, and more expeditious manner, and you
would have saved yourself a great deal of time and trouble if you had
attempted it. Why those superfluous machinations, why those expensive,
intricate, artificial, and give me leave to add, those fragile machines
which so easily may be destroyed? You could certainly have ensnared
Miguel in a more simple and a less precarious manner. Machineries like
those which you have made use of are always liable to the danger of
being discovered by accident, which may ruin the whole plan.</p>

<p>“You will perhaps reply, that, if he should make such a discovery, it
would be of little consequence; that you know this Miguel too well, are
too sensible of your superiority, that he cannot do without you, and
that you keep him in chains which he will not be able to shake off,
though your whole miraculous web should be dissolved in smoke. But, if
so, wherefore those needless artifices? What benefit will arise from
your miracles and ghosts? The love intrigue with Amelia, and the charm
of your eloquence would have been sufficient for gaining Miguel over to
our party.</p>

<p>“I may be mistaken, your proceedings are however riddles to me, if I
do not suppose that an arrogant activity has prompted you to contrive
extraordinary intrigues, and to have recourse to marvellous machineries.
People of your genius are wont to do so. You despise the ways of common
men, force new roads through insurmountable rocks, entangle your man in
numberless magic fetters, with no other view, than to have the pleasure
of seeing your prisoner insnare himself deeper and deeper by his
attempts to regain his liberty. The simple, artless turn of a play, does
not suit a genius like your’s, which delights only in knitting and
dissolving intricate knots, and in having recourse to artificial,
complicated machines; obstacles and dangers
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page219" id = "page219">219</a></span>
serve only to give additional energy to your activity. Miguel was,
perhaps, only an object which was to serve you for trying your skill and
art, in order to see how far you could rely on your capacities for more
important opportunities.</p>

<p>“But however it be, I am rather bound to thank you for your zeal to
serve our cause, than to criticise the choice of the means you have made
use of. Accomplish what you have begun, and you may be sure of my favour
and active gratitude.”</p>

<p>While I had been reading, the Duke walked up and down the room with
hasty strides. He now stopped. “Well, Marquis! well, Alumbrado!” said
he, “do I not act a charming part in this letter?”</p>

<p>We remained silent, became we saw that he was violently agitated.</p>

<p>“They treat me as a simpleton, as a blockhead. Is it not true?”</p>

<p>“How you exaggerate it!” said I. “They ascribe to you want of
experience, and that is all.”</p>

<p>“O Marquis, don’t you see in what a tone, and with how much contempt
the proud woman speaks of&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“She is a woman who mistakes you.”</p>

<p>“Heavens and earth! and I should brook her injuries without taking
revenge?”</p>

<p>“My Lord!” Alumbrado said, “in what relation have you been to the
Dutchess? I&nbsp;cannot see the connection of the whole affair?”</p>

<p>The Duke explained this connection to him, by discovering the share
he had had in the revolution.</p>

<p>Alumbrado was all attention during this account, and when it was
finished seemed to be absorbed in profound meditation.</p>

<p>“Friend!” said I to the Duke, “there are some more written
leaves”&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is Hiermanfor’s answer to the letter you have been reading.”</p>

<p>I read the letter aloud.</p>

<p>“It is with no I small astonishment that I find myself called to an
account, in the letter which your Grace did me the honour of writing to
me, for a point which I sincerely wish never had been mentioned. The
remarks you have made on it redound as much to the honour of your
Grace’s penetration and sagacity, as they tend to mortify me by
betraying me into a confession, which I would have refused to make to
any mortal living, except to so noble a challenger.</p>

<p>“My second letter to your Privy Secretary, explaining sufficiently
the motives which have prompted me to gain Miguel over to our party by
the arts of natural magic, I&nbsp;think I need not add new arguments to
those contained in that letter, if your Grace will take the trouble to
re-peruse and to ponder them attentively. Besides the reprehension of
your Grace is directed less against the means which I have made use of,
than against the manner of their application. You ask in
<span class = "pagenum">219b</span>
your letter, why I have had recourse to such superfluous machinations,
to such expensive, intricate, artificial, and fragile machines? Indeed
you think too contemptibly of Miguel. His penetration, as well as his
great knowledge, raise him far above the common men of his age; his
understanding, which has been improved under the tuition of an Antonio
de Galvez, is not to be imposed upon so easily as you think. Besides,
you will have the goodness to consider that he was not the only person I
had to deal with, and that his tutor, who never stirred from his side,
was always ready to cut asunder the magical bonds in which I had
entangled him, but why do I hesitate any longer to tell you the plain
truth? My design was not directed against Miguel alone, but on his tutor
too. It was the most ardent wish of my heart to gain this man to our
party by my magical arts, and that it was which forced me to have
recourse to so many machinations, and such expensive and complicated
machines. If my design upon him had been crowned with success, Miguel
too would have been an easy and certain conquest.</p>

<p>“If your Grace should ask what has prompted me to form so daring a
plan, and what reasons I had to hope for success? I&nbsp;beg you will
condescend to ponder the following points: Count Galvez was an
insurmountable obstacle in my way to Miguel, which rendered it necessary
either to draw him in our interest, or to remove him from his pupil. It
will be obvious to you for what reason I resolved to attempt the former,
if you will consider how much advantage our affairs would have derived
from so valuable a conquest. If we could have made sure of Antonio, we
then should also have drawn the court of Rome in our interest by his
intercession. Before the present Pope was raised to the papal throne, he
and a number of persons of the highest rank were intimately connected
with him. We could, therefore, have expected to interest for our cause
by his influence a court, which will become our most dangerous enemy, if
it should not take our part; and I apprehend this will be the case<ins

<p class = "center smallest extended">AN ORIGINAL ESSAY.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> predecessors of
Osmir were ignoble and obscure. For a race of generations they wept the
conflicts of indigence, nor could the toils of application crown their
efforts with advantage, nor the utmost frugality secure their labours
from distress; the importance of command never owned their authority,
and the radiance of splendour never shone on their dwelling. They eat of
the bread of industry, they drank the waters of perseverence, they lived
unnoticed and undistinguished among the children of poverty, as one atom
in the sun-beam is undistinguished from another, and as the ebullitions
of a current which float for a moment on its surface and die, even so
they disappeared and were remembered no more.</p>

<p>But the tempest of malediction began at length to subside, and the
severity of fortune to abate her resentment. Malevolence was wearied
with undeserved persecution, and prosperity beheld the cot of
wretchedness with an auspicious smile, and determined to lavish upon
Osmir what she had withheld from his ancestors. He was addicted to
industry, to perseverance and toil; his principles were therefore the
surest basis whereon time was to erect the superstructure of gilded
affluence. In a few years Osmir <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘comtemplated’">contemplated</ins> the fruits of his application,
which animated his endeavours to advance with more hasty strides in the
road of progressive grandeur; riches were accumulated, possessions were
established, his habitation surpassed the pomp of oriental magnificence,
and the report of his opulence was the talk of every mouth, and wafted
through every region on the pinions of fame. In order to subdue the
murmurs of repining adversity, and establish a position, which though it
was probable was yet untrue, that the bounties of Heaven were bestowed
upon deserving virtue alone, he resolved to cover his imperfections with
the mantle of devotion, by which more liberty was allowed to the
passions which lay lurking in secret within the chambers of his heart.
Confirmed in this disposition, he was impartial and correct in his
dealings with all men; the venom of slander had no influence on his
character; for he trod the paths of moral rectitude with exact
scrupulosity. Was propitiation ordained to avert the wrath of
omnipotence?&mdash;his head was covered with the ashes of Bethulia, and
his loins were mortified with the sack-cloth of Ninevah; his piety
refused the sustenance which human fragility demands for her functions,
and thrice a day he fell prostrate at the shrine of the God of nature.
Whenever Osmir walked the streets for the purpose of recreation, he was
begirt with attendants who showered gold on the multitude, and whom he
exhorted in their liberality to more extensive profusion. The widow and
the orphan, the desolate and the indigent, all looked for succour from
the bounty of his hand, and all felt the influence of his generous
condescension. Not an act that was performed escaped the voice of
applause, for if Osmir was liberal, compassionate or just, his merit was
instantly registered in the
<span class = "pagenum">220b</span>
chronicles of fame, who with her trump of seven thunders, blew a blast
round the world which was echoed through the universe.</p>

<p>Such was the life of a mortal whom prosperity delighted to elevate;
such was his journey through the vales of desolation, uninfested with
the thorns of accident or bitterness, and perfumed with the fragrance of
the rose-buds fortune scattered in his way. But whilst Osmir thus
employed the happy tenor of his days, now feasting on delicacies at the
banquet of plenty, now dancing to the song of happiness in the bowers of
ease, the iron hand of time laid its pressure on his temples, the frost
of old age was expanded through his veins, and the powers of animation
hastened quick to decline. It was in vain to bribe with riches the
dreaded minister of death; it was in vain to protract a moment the awful
period of dissolution. Summoned at the report of sickness his friends
assembled in his chamber, where stretched on the bed of sorrows, human
nature was to be dignified, and human weakness was to be confirmed by an
illustrious portrait of expiring virtue. But how great was the excess of
disappointment and surprize, when, instead of the tranquility of hope,
and ejaculations of charity, their ears were assaulted with the shrieks
of despair, and their eyes were affrighted with terrific wretchedness.
Osmir, whose visage was deformed with terrors, as the brow of heaven
with a tempest, was long unable to hearken to the remonstrances of his
friends; at length, however, collecting the feeble breath, which, like
the flame of a midnight taper, sat quivering on his lips, he uttered
these last accents with emphatic efforts, whilst every voice was
suspended in silence, and every ear was attention.</p>

<p>“Ye, whom vanity has influenced in the operation of good works, and
whom earthly approbation has taught to exult in their merit, let the
example of dying disquietudes abate the security of your confidence.
Like you, I&nbsp;have floated on the ocean of glory, I&nbsp;have felt my
senses enraptured with the melody of praise, and suffered my heart to
receive plaudits which my conscience condemned. Like you, I&nbsp;was
liberal, because to be liberal was to be eminent, and like you also,
I&nbsp;estimated the advantages of heaven by terrestial enjoyments.
Prosperity shed around me the partial beams of her favour, nor harboured
a doubt, nor hesitated to reflect, if the object of her veneration
deserved contempt or esteem. Avarice and vain glory were raging passions
of my soul, to heat the furnace of these desires was the sole object of
my aim; by the one I was rendered odious to the great dispenser of
gifts, and by the other detrimental to the sons and daughters of men.
This, by the malignity of its turpitude, which withheld what it had
received with the rapacious grasp of a vulture, effaced the character of
the Deity imprinted by nature in my soul; and the other by a cruelty
more inhuman than murder, has awakened passions in the breast of
indigence, which had slept for ever undisturbed, and for the mercenary
tribute of undeserved approbation has elevated for a moment to
magnificence
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page221" id = "page221">221</a></span>
and state, only to plunge with keener <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘anquish’">anguish</ins> into the gulphs of despair, the
wretch whose heart had never sickened for the splendours of pomp, and
whose days had moved calm in inglorious obscurity. Yet weak-sighted
mortals viewed my actions and admired, whilst the piercing eye of the
everlasting beheld their motives and abhorred. Happy should I be to
amend the past by the present, or to mitigate the fury of the
indignation to come. But the scymetar of vengeance hangs suspended in my
view, I&nbsp;hear the sentence of malediction which sounds as thunder in
my ears, and I feel the last horrors of agonizing despair. Insulting
vanities of a faithless world! why was my heart enamoured of the graces
of thy deceit? Only to look with pleasure on thy allurements, is to
assume the chains of thy bondage; to seek thy gratifications is to
follow pain without profit, and to persevere in thy pursuits is
reprobation without hope. A&nbsp;few moments space will evince the
dreadful truth, for a few moments space and the life of Osmir is no
more. Happy shall you be, my friends, whose errors are corrected by my
fatal mistake, and whose minds shall be imprinted with this important
remembrance, that no action however splendid can secure the favour of

<h4>SELECT REFLECTIONS ON EDUCATION.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A f</span>ortune acquired
by commerce, when it is discreetly expended in advancing learning,
acquires a grace and elegance, which a life devoted to the accumulation
of money, for its own sake, can seldom possess.</p>

<p>Few of us are so improved by philosophy, though we study and admire
it, as not to feel the influence of interested motives. This insensibly
blinds the understanding, and often impels the judgment to decide
unjustly, without the guilt of intention.</p>

<p>Not only the taste, but the religion, the virtue, and even the
liberties of our country, greatly depend upon that discipline which lays
the foundation of improvement in ancient learning. True patriotism and
true valour, originate from that enlargement of mind, which the
well-regulated study of philosophy, poetry, and history, tends to
produce; and if we can recal the ancient discipline we may perhaps recal
the generous spirit of ancient virtue. He who is conversant with the
best Greek and Roman writers, with a Plato, a&nbsp;Xenophon, and a
Cicero, must imbibe, if he be not deficient in the powers of intellect,
sentiments no less liberal and enlarged than ingenious and elegant.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">221b</span>
<p>A certain enlargement, refinement, and embellishment of the mind, is
the best and noblest effect of classical instruction. It is not only
desirable, as it qualifies the mind for this or that profession, but as
it opens the source of pure pleasures, unknown to the vulgar. Its
tendency is to adorn and improve human nature, and to give the ideas a
noble elevation.</p>

<p>The possession of an elegant mind is greatly superior to the
possession of a fortune, and the enjoyment of a good conscience is far
superior to both.</p>

<p>The passions will sometimes ruffle the stream of happiness in every
man; but they are least likely to discompose him, who spends his time in
letters, and who at the same time studies virtue and innocence, which
indeed have a natural connexion with true learning.</p>

<p>He who has caught the spirit of the polite writers of the politest
ages and cities, must possess a peculiar degree of polish and
comprehension of mind.</p>

<p>The best kind of education is that which endeavours to improve the
powers of understanding for their own sake; for the sake of exalting the
endowments of human nature, and becoming capable of sublime and refined
contemplation. This furnishes a power of finding satisfactory amusement
for those hours of solitude, which every man must sometimes know in the
busiest walks of life; and it constitutes one of the best supports of
old age, as well as the most graceful ornament of manhood. Even in the
commercial department it is most desirable; for besides that it gives a
grace to the man in the active stage of life, and in the midst of his
negociations, it ‘enables him to enjoy his retreat with elegance,’ when
his industry has accumulated the object of his endeavours.</p>

<p>If taste, which classical learning immediately tends to produce, have
no influence in amending the heart, or in promoting virtuous affections;
if it contribute not to render men more humane, and more likely to be
disgusted with improper behaviour, as a deformed object, and pleased
with rectitude of conduct, as beautiful in itself; if it be merely an
ornamental appendage; it must be owned, that life is indeed too short to
admit of long attention to mere embellishment. Polite learning, on the
contrary, is found to be friendly to all that is amiable and laudible in
social intercourse; friendly to morality. It has a secret but powerful
influence in softening and meliorating the disposition. True and correct
taste directly tends to restrain the extravagancies of passion, by
regulating that nurse of passion, a&nbsp;discorded imagination.</p>

<p>To be completely skilled in ancient learning is by no means a work of
such insuperable pains. The very progress itself is attended with
delight, and resembles a journey through some pleasant country, where
every mile we advance new charms arise. It is certainly as easy to be a
scholar, as a gamester, or many other characters equally illiberal and
low. The same application, the same quantity of habit, will fit us for
one as well as for the other. As to those who tell us with an air of
seeming wisdom, that it is by men, not books, that we must study to
become knowing; repeated experience teaches this to be the common
consolation and language of dunces.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">He</span> that would rise
superior to the common level of mankind, exalted in knowledge, useful to
himself and to mankind, must keep attention ever on the watch to seize
some subject worthy of reflection with a spirit of investigation, which
no difficulties can damp; he must suffer no proposition, however obscure
and intricate, to escape the grasp of his mind till perseverance hath
effected its solution: If any thing more than another occasions man to
differ more from man than man from beast, it is this; and I have been
often led to doubt, whether it will not alone account for all that
difference in mind which is commonly ascribed to superiority in
capacity. True indeed it is, that this improvement is not always
accompanied with delight. “Those reflections (says Burke) are melancholy
enough which carry us beyond the mere surface of things.” The world
exhibits too much evil to the mind to permit its reflections to be
uniformly pleasant. But as the same author again observes, the same
philosophy which causes the grief, will administer the comfort; and
would not he or any other, who possesses this most valuable attainment,
prefer it, with all its sorrows, to a state of thoughtless inattention?
Of all the complaints of studious men, want of memory is the greatest
and the most frequent. So universal indeed is the expression of sorrow
for deficiency in retentive capacity, that this faculty would seem a
gift most sparingly <ins class = "correction"
title = ": missing">bestowed:</ins> the distinguishing characteristic of a few, the
happy favorites of nature. But without favour and without respect,
nature holds the balance of being with impartial hand, and with very few
exceptions, every member of humanity is equal in the scale.</p>

<p>Man was endowed with the seeds of his faculties to be matured by his
cultivation and memory; not the least of those faculties is in the least
subject to his power. That men, when placed in similar circumstances,
will receive through the senses similar impressions, I&nbsp;trust will
be universally admitted. It appears to me no less evident, that such
impressions may be in all equally lasting. It is not then the want of
capacity in any to retain, but the want of exertion in most to imprint,
that occasions the former; and Man, not Nature, is deficient in duty.
Yet, this charge is not universally incurred; many there are who employ
much of their time in endeavouring to improve the faculty of
recollection, but in spite of their efforts, they still find ample cause
for complaint. If men (generally speaking) are equally fitted both to
receive and to retain, the charge must still revert upon themselves,
with the aggravation of time mispent in injudicious exertions. The
method generally pursued among young men to assist the memory, is to
enter into a common place book the most material observations and events
in the course of their reading; this, though stamped with the
approbation
<span class = "pagenum">222b</span>
and deriving credit from the recommendation of the philosophic Locke, is
not without its imperfections. The practice betrays the student into a
prejudicial confidence, trusting to his notes, he neglects to make the
first impressions firm and lasting; and in his recurrences to his book
he distracts his attention with a vast collection of heterogeneous
matter; the different parts of which hold a place in his recollection no
longer than he reads them, each being driven out by that which succeeds.
“What is twice read (says the judicious author of the Idler,) is
commonly better remembered than what is described:” and no little credit
is due to this opinion, when delivered by a man, the value and extent of
whose literary acquisitions deservedly gained him the appellation of the
walking library. As the impression made by one body on another is
stronger or weaker in proportion to the time of pressure, so the
firmness with which an idea is fixed in the memory, is in proportion to
the weight applied by the continuance of thought. Let the reader, before
he changes his subjects, revolve with patient attention in his mind the
sentiments he would imbibe, or the events he would remember, until he
has thoroughly stamped them with all the principles and consequences of
the former, and the causes, connections and effects of the latter. Let
him in the solitary hour when books are not near, and company do not
interrupt by continued reflection, firmly imprint spontaneous
associations, and by studious recollection renew and confirm the past.
The knowledge so gained will be far more solid and lasting than that for
which we depend upon a few uncorrected transcriptions. Conversation has
with justice been called the soul of society. Man must, in intercourse
with his fellow creatures, exercise and refine those passions and
affections with which he is endowed, and of which they are the subjects:
and in the worlds of business and of pleasure, the convenience and
happiness of each state, depends upon the united endeavours of the
whole; so in the world of literature, a&nbsp;mutual communication of
ideas increases the stock of individual knowledge. While the student
disdains not to converse with men in every rank, let him choose for his
intimates the ingenious and the learned. One great impediment in the way
of mental improvement, is the neglect of opportunities for study. Carpe
diem, is an advice as generally unattended to as its goodness is
admitted. The state of the mind is no more than that of the body is
uniform and regular. Various as the atmospheric changes, it is now dull,
inapprehensive and listless; now flighty and impatient, again in happier
hour, fitted to imbibe with avidity, comprehend with clearness, and
retain with exactness. How often in this vigorous and active state are
its impulses neglected. How often when disgust succeeds enjoyment, when
satiated with pleasure, and fatigued with the tumults of society, the
mind is disengaged and vacant; with an appetite whetted for the variety
of solid entertainment, do we instead of gratifying its propensity, seat
ourselves down to indulge idle regret, or to form still more idle
schemes of future dissipation. To seize such, and every opportune
moment, we should be ever on the watch, they will frequently occur, and
if improved will always produce
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page223" id = "page223">223</a></span>
present delight and permanent advantage. To complain of nature when
ourselves are in the fault, and to ascribe to deficiency of capacity,
what is the result of want of industry, is the common practice of
idleness in every condition of life. But in spite of the clamours of
men, it will ever remain an axiom in morals, that want of judgment in
acting, is the cause of embarrassment and confusion; and cessation from
labour, the death of body and mind.</p>


<hr class = "article w25">

<h4><span class = "giant">INDUSTRY</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Diligence</span>, and
proper improvement of time, are material duties of the young. To no
purpose are they endued with the best abilities, if they want activity
for exerting them. In youth the habits of industry are most easily
acquired.&mdash;In youth the incentives to it are the strongest; from
ambition and from duty, from emulation and hope, all the prospects which
the beginning of life affords.</p>

<p>Industry is not only the instrument of improvement, but the
foundation of pleasure. He who is a stranger to it may possess, but
cannot enjoy; for it is labour only which gives relish to
pleasure.&mdash;It is the indispensible condition of our possessing a
sound mind in a sound body.</p>

<p>We should seek to fill our time with employments which may be
reviewed with satisfaction. The acquisition of knowledge is one of the
most honourable occupations of youth. The desire of it discovers a
liberal mind, and is connected with many accomplishments, and many
virtues. But though our train of life should not lead us to study, the
course of education always furnishes proper employments to a
well-disposed mind. Whatever we pursue, we should be emulous to
excel.</p>

<p>Generous ambition and sensibility to praise, are, especially at the
youthful period, among the marks of virtue. We never ought to think that
any affluence of fortune, or any elevation of rank, exempts us from the
duties of application and industry: industry is the law of our being; it
is the demand of nature, of reason, and of God.</p>

<h4><span class = "super">HUMANITY</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Gentleness</span>, which
belongs to virtue, is to be carefully distinguished from the mean spirit
of cowards, and the fawning assent of sycophants.&mdash;It renounces no
just right from fear:<span class = "locked">---</span>it gives up no
important truth from flattery:&mdash;it is indeed not only consistent
with a firm mind, but it necessarily requires a manly spirit and a fixed
principle in order to give it any real value.</p>

<p>It stands opposed to harshness and severity&mdash;to pride and
arrogance&mdash;to violence and oppression:&mdash;it is, properly, that
part of the real virtue charity, which makes us unwilling to give pain
to any of our brethren.&mdash;&mdash;It corrects whatever is offensive
in our manners, and, by a constant train of humane attentions, studies
to alleviate the burden of common misery;&mdash;Its office is therefore
extensive; it is continually in action, when we are engaged in
intercourse with men.&mdash;It ought to form our address, to regulate
our speech, and to diffuse itself over our whole behaviour.</p>

<p>That gentleness which is a characteristic of a good man, has, like
every other virtue, its seat in the heart.&mdash;&mdash;In that
unaffected civility which springs from a gentle mind, there is a charm
infinitely more powerful than in all the studied manners of the most
finished courtier.</p>

<p>It is founded on a sense of what we owe to him who made us, and to
the common nature of which we all share.&mdash;It arises from reflection
on our own failings and wants, and from just views of the condition and
duty of man.<span class = "locked">---</span>It is native feeling
heightened and improved by principle. It is the heart which easily
resents; which feels for every thing that is human; and is backward and
slow to inflict the least wound. It is affable in its address, and mild
in its demeanour; ever ready to oblige, and be obliged by others;
breathing habitual kindness towards friends, courtesy to strangers, long
suffering to enemies.</p>

<p>It exercises authority with moderation;---administers reproof with
tenderness; confers favours with care and modesty.<span class =
"locked">---</span>It is unassuming in opinion, and temperate in
zeal.<span class = "locked">---</span>It contends not eagerly about
trifles; slow to contradict, and still slower to blame; but prompt to
allay dissention and restore peace.<span class = "locked">---</span>It
neither intermeddles
<span class = "pagenum">225b</span>
unnecessarily with the affairs, nor pries inquisitively into the secrets
of others.<span class = "locked">---</span>It delights above all things
to alleviate distress; and, if it cannot dry up the falling tear, to
soothe at least the grieving heart.</p>

<p>Where it has not the power of being useful, it is never
burdensome.<span class = "locked">---</span>It seeks to please rather
than shine and dazzle, and conceals with care that superiority, either
of talents or of rank, which are oppressive to those who are beneath
it.<span class = "locked">---</span>It is a great avenue to mutual
enjoyment: amidst the strife of interfering interests, it tempers the
violence of contention, and keeps alive the seeds of harmony.<span class

renders the countenance of a man a refreshment to man.<span class =
"locked">---</span>It prepossesses and wins every heart.<span class =

disarms the fierce, and melts the stubborn.</p>

<p>To the man of humanity the world is generally disposed to ascribe
every other good quality; of its influence all in some degree partake,
therefore all love&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The man of this character rises in the world without struggle, and
flourishes without envy; his misfortunes are universally lamented, and
his failings are easily forgiven. The inward tranquility which it
promotes is the first requisite of every pleasurable feeling. It is the
calm and clear atmosphere, the serenity and sunshine of the mind.</p>

<p>Attacked by great injuries, the man of mild and gentle spirit will
feel what human nature feels; and will defend and resent as his duty
allows him: but to slight provocations he is happily superior. Inspired
with noble sentiments, taught to regard, with an indulgent eye, the
frailties of men, the omissions of the careless, the follies of the
imprudent, and the levity of the fickle; he retreats into the calmness
of his spirit, as into an undisturbed sanctuary, and quietly allows the
usual current of life to hold its course.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“What</span> a triumph
would it have proved to me, if I had succeeded in my attempt to subdue
this man through my magical operations, and to catch in <i>one</i> snare
two persons of so great an importance to our cause. The idea of
ensnaring the Count by means of miracles and ghosts, was indeed,
a&nbsp;very bold one, but not so inconsiderate as it may appear at first
sight. Antonio has spent the earlier years of his youth in a monastery
at Rome. It was not unknown to me, that experience and meditation have
enabled him afterwards to divest himself of the prejudices which there
have been instilled in his mind; I&nbsp;was, however, at the same time,
well aware that the impressions we receive in our juvenile days, are
<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘re-preduced’">re-produced</ins> with vivacity on certain occasions.
I&nbsp;also knew that his philosophy does not deny the existence of
spirits, and the hope of futurity which he defended with enthusiasm,
<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘rendres’">renders</ins> the
human mind but too prone to give credit to the apparitions of spirits,
if they have the appearance of reality. Even his propensity to
speculation, his fondness of solitude, the interest he took in
supersensitive objects, his melancholy temper, prompted me to expect
that my artifices would find access to his heart; and if the heart is
but interested for something, then the understanding too is generally
<i>half</i> gained. However, he who intends to gain it <i>entirely</i>,
must take care not to expose his blind side to a keen-sighted and pert
genius, and for that reason I was obliged to endeavour to carry the
illusion to the highest degree of probability; I&nbsp;was under the
necessity of attempting to make it impossible to Count Galvez to
penetrate my delusions. This will convince your Grace that my plan, how
bold soever it might have been, has not been formed without
<i>probability of success</i>. However, when Count Clairval began to
cultivate a more intimate connexion with Antonio, I&nbsp;was made
sensible that my expectations have been too sanguine.</p>

<p>“He entreated me to give up a design that never could succeed.
Prudence commanded me to follow his advice, though it mortified my
ambition extremely. No other expedient was now left than to remove Count
Galvez from his pupil, because I apprehended that he would ruin my
design on Miguel. Your Grace knows how successfully this was
executed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will ask, whether it would not have been possible to
gain Count Galvez for our cause by some other means? I&nbsp;must reply
in the negative. Miguel could indeed have been ensnared by other meant,
but not more <i>expeditiously</i>; (and every thing depended upon
dispatch) but his tutor never. The latter is attached to the King of
Sp**n with unshaken loyalty, because he thinks it his <i>duty</i> to be
loyal; and a man of fifty years, of so firm and rooted principles,
<span class = "pagenum">226b</span>
cannot be enticed from what he thinks to be his duty, before it ceases
to be duty to him. But what power upon earth could absolve from <ins
class = "correction" title = "wording and italics as shown"><i>a duty
such</i></ins> a man? Here supernatural powers must interfere and
absolve him, beings from another world must appear as bails.</p>

<p>“I can scarcely think that the failure of this plan has originated
from a fault of mine, for I have tried every means of exhibiting my
miracles and ghosts in a shape of probability. Yet this has entangled me
on the other side in a very disagreeable dilemma. Miguel, to whom his
tutor has rendered suspected even my most consummate artifices, must be
kept steady in the course he once has taken. I&nbsp;shall, perhaps, be
necessitated to perform something quite extraordinary in order to fix
the mind of this wavering young man who is constantly pressing forwards.
Thus I think to have given a satisfactory answer to the question why I
have introduced so expensive, complicated and artificial machines.</p>

<p>“If your Grace should ask why I have kept my design on Miguel’s tutor
so secret, then I must tell you, that I concealed it so carefully
because I intended to surprise the confederates unexpectedly by my
valuable acquisition, if I should have succeeded; and if not to spare
myself the mortification of having it said that I had undertaken a task
to which my powers were not equal. I&nbsp;hope your Grace will reward my
frank and plain confession by burying it in eternal secrecy.”</p>

<p>I returned the letter to the Duke, and a long silence ensued. He
broke it first.</p>

<p>“My friend, you know my adventures with this Irishman, what do you
think of him?”</p>

<p>“How can you ask that question after all the discoveries we have
already made?”</p>

<p>“I wish to have it answered by you.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said I in a pathetic accent, “that Irishman must be a
supernatural being.”</p>

<p>“Ridicule me as long as you please&mdash;I cannot but confess that he
is, nevertheless, incomprehensible to&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“My dear Duke, I know what I am to think of the Irishman, but I
scarcely know what to think of you.”</p>

<p>“You disapprove of my connection with that man.”</p>

<p>“Very much.”</p>

<p>“Tell me your sentiments without reserve; I know you have had a
strong desire for some time to come to an explanation with&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“You have been ill, and I wish to spare you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want your forbearance. Speak.”</p>

<p>“At another time, my friend, at another time.”</p>

<p>“No delay. Alumbrado is no stranger to my history, and consequently
may hear your observation on&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>“If you insist upon if, then I must tell you that I am extremely
vexed at the idea that the fellow, who dared to sport with your
understanding has enjoyed the triumph of guiding you in leading-strings
whithersoever he chose. I&nbsp;am glad that you have rendered his
magical labours so toilsome; I&nbsp;am rejoiced at the resistance which
you have opposed to his attacks; but
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page227" id = "page227">227</a></span>
it grieves me that he has conquered you so dishonestly and artfully.
I&nbsp;cannot but confess that the artifice to which your penetration
yielded, has been enormous; however, I&nbsp;am angry with you because
the man whom you really had discovered to be a cheat, succeeded a second
time in gaining your confidence.”</p>

<p>“Do you then imagine that the Irishman has imposed on me in the
latter period of our connection as well as in the beginning
of&nbsp;it?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p>“That this occult science consists merely in juggling tricks<ins
class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">?”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“In <i>natural</i> arts of all kind.”</p>

<p>“By what natural means could he have affected the apparition of
Antonio at the church-yard?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell; however, we should probably have learned it from the
Count if he had not been suffered to escape.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you remind me of the Count. Why did he refuse so
obstinately to explain that incident in spite of my prayers and menaces,
declaring solemnly that it had been effected by supernatural means,
although he has candidly discovered the rest of the delusions of the
Irishman. What benefit could he expect from deceiving me any longer, the
revolution being established, and consequently his end attained?”</p>

<p>“Has he not confessed that he is in the service of the Irishman? Can
you know what orders he has received from his employer? Was not the veil
of mystery which the Count has thrown over that incident, the only
remaining mean of supporting the authority of his lord and master? Who
knows what he would have confessed if you had shown a firm resolution to
enforce your menaces?”</p>

<p>“I confess I acted very weakly and rashly, in suffering him to escape
so soon.”</p>

<p>“At bottom it matters very little. What confidence could you have
reposed in the confession of a man, who on a former occasion has imposed
on you in so shameless and daring a manner? And what will you say <ins
class = "correction" title = "text has ‘If’">if</ins> I prove to you
that he has belied you the last time too?”</p>

<p>“You astonish me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you recollect that he pretended the note through which Amelia
has been absolved from her vow by her late Lord, to have been the effect
of Hiermanfor’s supernatural power?”</p>

<p>“Not only the Count, Hiermanfor too has made me believe it.”</p>

<p>“Both of them has told you a barefaced lie.”</p>

<p>“Friend, how will you be able to make good your charge?”</p>

<p>“By proving that pretended miracle to be a juggling trick.”</p>

<p>“You have raised my expectation to the highest pitch.”</p>

<p>“I have learned that trick of a juggler, and I am sure that which the
Irishman has made use of is the same. He gave Amelia a blank slip of
paper, and
<span class = "pagenum">227b</span>
directed her to write the question on the upper part of it. Here you
must regard three points; first of all, that he <i>himself</i> gave the
paper, to Amelia; secondly, that he desired the question to be written
on the upper part of it; and thirdly, that he dictated the question to
her; he then put the paper on the table, fumigated the apartment with an
incense of his own composition, and requested the Countess to look at
the paper in the morning. It was very natural that the answer to the
question was seen beneath it, having been previously written with
sympathetic ink the preceding evening, but first rendered visible in the
night by the fumigation. Very likely it had been written by the Count,
who could imitate the hand-writing of his brother.”</p>

<p>The Duke gazed at me along while, seized with dumb astonishment. At
length he clapped his hands joyfully, exclaiming, “O! my friend, what a
light have you cast upon that dark mysterious affair.”</p>

<p>“A light,” my reply was, “that will assist you to see clearly how
dishonestly the Irishman and the Count have dealt with you to the last.
They endeavoured to persuade you that you had been deceived at first,
merely for the sake of probation, and that you had been paid with
sterling truth after Paleski’s discovery. Poor deceived man; you have
always been beset with lies and delusions; the sole point in which they
differed from each other, consisting merely in the superior art which
the latter impositions were contrived with.”</p>

<p>“Then you believe that the apparition at the church-yard has also
been a deception, like the incident with the miraculous note.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have every reason to think so. When I have once caught a
person in the act of committing a fraud, I&nbsp;then have the greatest
right to suppose that he has repeatedly imposed upon me; and when I am
convinced that he has frequently deceived me, I&nbsp;then have the
greatest reason to conclude that he has cheated me the last time
also.”</p>

<p>“Then you think a real apparition of a ghost to be impossible.”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that question? All that we have to decide at present,
is, whether the Irishman or any man living can effect such an
apparition.”</p>

<p>“You want to evade my question.”</p>

<p>“Indeed not!”</p>

<p>“Then tell me, do you think apparitions of ghosts to be
possible?”</p>

<p>“Tell me, does not this question imply, that, are men capable of
seeing ghosts?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p><ins class = "notation"

<p class = "center extended">[<span class = "smallest">BY
HERSELF.</span>]</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I shall</span> not regret
tracing the sorrows which marked the morning of my life. If I can
inspire suffering virtue with confidence in heaven, and a gentle hope
that when chastened in the school of adversity, the hand of happiness
will amply recompense those who have patiently sustained its rough
discipline.</p>

<p>At the tender age of sixteen I was deprived of a mother, whose loss I
had every reason to deplore, as her precepts instilled into my
inexperienced heart wisdom, and her example taught me to persevere in
the path of virtue; though crossed with sorrows and perplexed with
difficulties, she was prepared for that hour which so unexpectedly
arrived, and launched her spotless into eternity. My father, Sir George
Blandford, ah! how different from her in every respect, nobly descended,
and possessed of an affluent fortune, he thought himself superior to the
world; his soul was filled with pride, and he looked down with
haughtiness on the rest of mankind. He had a son five years older than
me; gentle, generous, and like his departed mother, susceptible of every
soft impression; he was abroad at her death, which happened in London,
and from which place Sir George determined immediately to bring me to
his seat in the country. With melancholy hearts, we commenced our
journey, the second day crossing a little stream, we found ourselves in
imminent danger, owing to a violent fall of rain, which had rendered the
current so rapid, the horses vainly struggled against it&mdash;in a few
moments we should inevitably have perished, but for the interposition of
a young man, who standing on the opposite bank, perceived our situation,
and with wonderful presence of mind rushed into the water and assisted
the men in bringing the carriage to shore. I&nbsp;had fainted from
terror, a&nbsp;small cottage stood at a little distance to which they
conveyed me, after a few remedies I revived. My apprehensions being
over, I&nbsp;had an opportunity of contemplating the figure of my
generous deliverer, whose resolution excited my warmest gratitude. He
was just at that period of life when youth loses itself in manhood; his
person strikingly elegant, his face expressive of the greatest
sensibility, and his fine eyes beaming with a soft melancholy which
seemed to announce him the son of sorrow. My father thanked him with as
much warmth as he could assume, but a nobler gratitude rose in my soul,
for from that hour I loved. With pain I heard the carriage announced,
and entered it, I&nbsp;durst not talk of him, the rigidity of Sir
George’s disposition, prevented&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>The estate to which we were going I had never been at, but its castle
was held in wonderful estimation by my father. He confirmed it as an
honourable memorial of the antiquity of his ancestors. At our arrival I
was struck with horror; the ravages of all-conquering time were in
several places displayed; a&nbsp;dark wood surrounded it, impenetrable
to the chearing rays of the resplendant luminary; thro’ vistas cut
amidst the thick boughs of old oaks, a&nbsp;cataract was espied foaming
with impetuous
<span class = "pagenum">228b</span>
fury down the side of a stupenduous mountain, from which a muddy stream
took its course in hoarse murmurings through the wood. What an
habitation for a mind already depressed, it filled mine with gloomy
sadness, which I durst not manifest, for to dislike my father’s
favourite mansion would have incurred his severest displeasure.
A&nbsp;fortnight after my arrival, I&nbsp;obtained with difficulty,
permission to spend some time with a young lady whom I had known from my
infancy, and loved with the tenderest affection. We spent our days
delightfully; happy in each other’s society, they glided insensibly
away. Riding early one morning with her, my horse, alarmed by the
shouting of some thoughtless boys going to school, notwithstanding all
my efforts, flew off at a rate that terrified me with the idea of every
moment being dashed off.</p>

<p>From those fears I was relieved by a man springing from behind a
hedge, who catching the bridle, stopt my rapid career&mdash;but what
were my <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘omotions’">emotions</ins> on perceiving he was the generous deliverer
who had before saved me? More overcome by my sensations than fright,
I&nbsp;sunk half fainting in his arms, he appeared equally affected.
“Great Heaven!” cried he, “what transport! twice to have saved this
precious life!” My friend here arrived&mdash;she congratulated me on my
escape<span class = "locked">---</span>our horses were given to the
servants; she asked the charming stranger to accompany us to her house.
I&nbsp;would have prest him to accept her invitation, but shame withheld
my faultering accents. My conversation now wholly ran on this adventure.
Miss Rivers, (the name of my friend) frequently rallied me upon it;
I&nbsp;would blush, perhaps be silent, but quickly again begin the
pleasing topic. A&nbsp;mandate now arrived from Sir George for me to
return home. I&nbsp;obeyed, though with pain. As usual he received me
with haughty coldness.<span class = "locked">---</span>At night, my maid
whom I had left at home, began to relate the occurrences which happened
during my absence, and at length ended her narrative by saying the old
gardener was discharged, and a new one hired in his place, the sweetest
prettiest fellow she ever beheld. Indeed he was a little melancholy, but
certainly it was owing to his situation which he appeared not designed
for. I&nbsp;laughed and said I fancied he had made a conquest of her,
she foolishly tittered, as if the idea was very pleasant. The next
morning, as was my usual custom, I&nbsp;rose early and entered the
garden. I&nbsp;directed my steps to a little walk shaded by poplars. At
a distance I discerned a man busily employed, whom I conjectured to be
the new accomplished gardener. As I approached nearer I perceived him
start, and with precipitation hurry from the spot in his eagerness to
avoid me. His foot stumbled and he fell. I&nbsp;was just beginning an
involuntary exclamation of are you hurt? when raising his head,
I&nbsp;perceived my preserver. Amazement seized me, I&nbsp;had not power
to move, the deepest confusion tinged his cheek, he could not raise his
eyes, he attempted to speak, but his tremulous voice was unintelligible.
I&nbsp;could not stir till the appearance of my father roused me;
I&nbsp;started and hurried from the spot.</p>

<p class = "center smallest">AN ESSAY</p>

<h4>ON PITY AND BENEVOLENCE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Pity</span> has been
generally considered as the passion of gentle, benevolent, and virtuous
minds; although it is acknowledged to produce only such a participation
of the calamity of others, as upon the whole is pleasing to
ourselves.</p>

<p>As a tender participation of foreign distress, it has been urged to
prove, that man is endowed with social affections, which, however
forcible, are wholly disinterested: and as a pleasing sensation, it has
been deemed an example of unmixed selfishness and malignity. It has been
resolved into that power of imagination by which we apply the
misfortunes of others to ourselves: we have been said to pity, no longer
than we fancy ourselves to suffer; and to be pleased, only by reflecting
that our sufferings are not real; thus indulging a dream of distress
from which we can awake whenever we please, to exult in our security,
and enjoy the comparison of the fiction with truth.</p>

<p>Pity is generally understood to be that passion, which is excited by
the sufferings of persons with whom we have no tender connection, and
with whose welfare the stronger passions have not united our felicity;
for no man would call the anguish of a mother, whose infant was torn
from her breast and left to be devoured in a desart, by the name of
pity; although the sentiments of a stranger, who should drop a silent
tear at the relation, which yet might the next hour be forgotten, could
not otherwise be justly denominated.</p>

<p>If pity, therefore, is absorbed in another passion, when our love of
those that suffer is strong; pity is rather an evidence of the weakness
than the strength of that general philanthropy for which some have so
eagerly contended, with which they have flattered the pride and veiled
the vices of mankind, and which they have affirmed to be alone
sufficient to recommend them to the favour of Heaven, to atone for the
indulgence of every appetite, and the neglect of every duty.</p>

<p>If human benevolence was absolutely pure and social, it would not be
necessary to relate the ravages of a pestilence or a famine with minute
and discriminating circumstances to rouse our sensibility: we should
certainly deplore irremediable calamity, and participate temporary
distress, without any mixture of delight. That deceitful sorrow, in
which pleasure is so well known to be predominant, that invention has
been busied for ages in contriving tales of fictitious sufferings for no
other end than to excite it, would be changed into honest commiseration
in which pain would be unmixed, and which, therefore, we should wish to
lose.</p>

<p>Soon after the fatal battle of Fontenoy, a young gentleman, who came
over with the officer that brought the express, being expected at the
house of a friend, a&nbsp;numerous company of gentlemen and ladies were
assembled to hear an account of the action from an eye-witness.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">229b</span>
<p>The gentleman, as every man is flattered by commanding attention, was
easily prevailed upon to gratify the company, as soon as they were
seated, and the first ceremonies past. He described the march of many
thousands of their countrymen into the field, where batteries had been
concealed on each side, which in a moment strewed the ground with
mangled limbs and carcasses that almost floated in blood, and obstructed
the path of those who followed to the slaughter. He related, how often
the decreasing multitude returned to the cannon; how suddenly they were
rallied, and how suddenly broken; he repeated the list of officers who
had fallen undistinguished in the carnage, men whose eminence rendered
their names universally known, their influence extensive, and their
attachments numerous; and he hinted the fatal effects which this defeat
might produce to the nation, by turning the success of the war against
us. But the company, however amused by the relation, appeared not to be
affected by the event: they were still attentive to every trifling
punctilio of ceremony, usual among well bred persons; they bowed with a
graceful simper to a lady who sneezed, mutually presented each other
with snuff, shook their heads and changed their posture at proper
intervals, asked some questions which tended to produce a more minute
detail of such circumstances of horror as had been lightly touched, and
having at last remarked that the Roman patriot regretted the brave could
die but once, the conversation soon became general, and a motion was
made to divide into parties at whist. But just as they were about to
comply, the gentleman again engaged their attention. I&nbsp;forgot
(said&nbsp;he) to relate one particular; which, however, deserves to be
remembered. The captain of a company, whose name I cannot now recollect,
had, just before his corps was ordered to embark, married a young lady
to whom he had been long tenderly attached, and who, contrary to the
advice of friends, and the expostulations, persuasion and entreaty of
her husband, insisted to go abroad with him, and share his fortune at
all events. If he should be wounded, she said, that she might hasten his
recovery, and alleviate his pain, by such attendance as strangers cannot
be hired to pay; if he should be taken prisoner, she might, perhaps, be
permitted to shorten the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘tegious’">tedious</ins> hours of captivity, which solitude would
protract; and if he should die, that it would be better for her to know
it with certainty and speed, than to wait at a distance in anxiety and
suspense, tormented by doubtful and contradictory reports, and at last
believing it possible, that if she had been present, her assiduity and
tenderness might have preserved his life. The captain, though he was not
convinced by her reasoning, was yet overcome by the importunate
eloquence of her love: he consented to her request, and they embarked
together.</p>

<p>The head quarters of the duke of Cumberland were at Brussoel, from
whence they removed the evening before the battle to Monbray,
a&nbsp;village within musket shot of the enemy’s lines, where the
captain who commanded in the left wing, was encamped.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page230" id = "page230">230</a></span>
<p>Their parting in the morning was short. She looked after him, till he
could no longer be distinguished from others; and as soon as the firing
began she went back pale and trembling, and sat down expecting the event
in an agony of impatience, anxiety and terror. She soon learned from
stragglers and fugitives, that the slaughter was dreadful, and the
victory hopeless. She did not, however, yet despair; she hoped that the
captain might return among the few that should remain: But soon after
the retreat, this hope was cut off, and she was informed that he fell in
the first charge, and was left among the dead. She was restrained by
those about her, from rushing in the phrenzy of desperation to the field
of battle, of which the enemy was still possessed; but the tumult of her
mind having abated, and her grief become more calm during the night, she
ordered a servant to attend her at break of day; and as leave had been
given to bury the dead, she went herself to seek the remains of her
husband, that she might honour them with the last rites, and pour the
tears of conjugal affection upon his grave. They wandered about among
the dying and the dead, gazing on every distorted countenance, and
looked round with irresolution and amazement on a scene, which those who
stripped had left tenfold more a sight of horror than those who had
slain. From this sight she was at last turning with confusion and
despair, but was stopped by the cries of a favourite spaniel, who had
followed her without being perceived. He was standing at some distance
in the field; and the moment she saw him, she conceived the strongest
assurance that he had found his master. She hasted instantly to the
place without regarding any other object; and stooping over the corps by
which he stood, she found it so disfigured with wounds and besmeared
with blood, that the features were not to be known: But, as she was
weeping in the anguish of suspence, she discovered hanging on the wrist
the remains of a ruffle, round which there was a slight border of her
own work. Thus suddenly to have discovered, and in such dreadful
circumstances, that which she had sought, quite overwhelmed her, and she
sunk down on the body. By the assistance of the servant, she was
recovered to sensibility, but not to reason; she was seized at once with
convulsions and madness; and a few hours after she was carried back to
the village she expired.</p>

<p>Those who had heard the fate of whole battalions without pity, and
the loss of a battle, by which their country would probably suffer
irreparable damage, without concern, listened to a tale of private
distress with uninterrupted attention. All regard to each other was for
a while suspended; tears by degrees overflowed every eye, and every
bosom became susceptible of pity: But the whole circle paused with
evident regret, when the narrative was at an end: and would have been
glad that such another could have been told, to continue their
entertainment.&mdash;Such was the benevolence of pity! But a lady who
had taken the opportunity of a very slight acquaintance to satisfy her
curiosity, was touched with much deeper distress; and fainting in the
struggle to conceal the emotions of her mind, fell back in her chair. An
<span class = "pagenum">230b</span>
accident which was not sooner discovered, because every eye had been
fixed upon the speaker, and all attention monopolized by the story.
Every one, however, was ready to afford her assistance; and it was soon
discovered, that she was mother to the lady whose distress had afforded
so much virtuous pleasure to the company. It was not possible to tell
her another story, which would revive the same sensations; and if it
had, the world could not have bribed her to have heard it. Her affection
to the sufferer was too strong to permit her, on this occasion, to enjoy
the luxury of pity, and applaud her benevolence for sensations which
shewed its defects. It would, indeed, be happy for us, if we were to
exist only in this state of imperfection, that a greater share of
sensibility is not allowed us; but if the mole, in the kindness of
unerring Wisdom, is permitted scarce to distinguish light from darkness,
the mole should not surely, be praised for the perspicuity of its
sight.</p>

<p>Let us distinguish that malignity, which others confound with
benevolence, and applaud as virtue, let the imperfection of nature,
which is adapted to this imperfect state, teach us humility; and fix our
dependence upon Him, who has promised to “create in us a new heart and a
right spirit,” and to receive us to that place, where our love of
others, however ardent, can only increase our felicity; because, in that
place, there will be no object, but such as perfect benevolence can
contemplate with delight.</p>

<h4>REMARKABLE OCCURRENCE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Mr</span>. Cecil, assuming
the name of Jones, some years since, purchased a small piece of land,
and built on it a neat house on the edge of a common in Wiltshire. Here
he long resided, unknowing, and almost unknown, by the neighbourhood.
Various conjectures were formed respecting this solitary and singular
stranger; at length a clergyman took some notice of him, and
occasionally inviting him to his house, he found him possessed of
intelligence and manners, which evidently indicated his origin to have
been in the higher stations of life. Returning one day from a visit at
this clergyman’s, he passed the house of a farmer, at the door of which
was the daughter employed at the washing-tub. He looked at the girl a
moment, and thus accosted her.&mdash;“My girl, would you like to be
married?” “Sir!” exclaimed the girl.<span class = "locked">---</span>“I
asked you, young woman, whether you would wish to be married; because,
if you would, I&nbsp;will marry you,” “Lord, Sir! these are strange
questions from a man I never saw in my life before.” “Very likely,”
replied Mr. Jones; “but, however, I&nbsp;am serious, and will leave you
till ten o’clock to-morrow to consider of it; I&nbsp;will then call on
you again, and if I have your and your father’s consent, we will be
married the following day.”</p>

<p>He kept his appointment, and meeting with the father, he thus
addressed him: “Sir, I&nbsp;have seen your daughter; I&nbsp;should like
her for a wife; and I am come to ask your
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page231" id = "page231">231</a></span>
consent.” “This proposal,” answered the old man, “is very extraordinary
from a perfect stranger: Pray, sir, who are you? and what are you?”
“Sir,” replied Mr.&nbsp;J. “you have a right to ask these questions: my
name is Jones; the new house on the edge of the common is mine, and if
it be necessary, I&nbsp;can purchase your house and farm, and half the
neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>Another hour’s conversation, brought all parties into one mind, and
the friendly clergyman aforementioned united the happy pair. Three or
four years they lived in this retirement, and were blessed with two
children. Mr.&nbsp;J. employed great part of his time in improving his
wife’s mind, but never disclosing his own origin. At length, upon taking
a journey of pleasure with her, while remarking the beauties of the
country, he noticed and named the different gentlemen’s seats as they
passed; and coming to a very magnificent one, “This, my dear,” said he,
“is Burleigh house, the seat of the earl of Exeter, and, if you please,
we will go in and ask leave to look at it: it is an elegant house, and
probably will amuse you.”</p>

<p>The nobleman who possessed this mansion was lately dead. He once had
a nephew, who, in the gaities of his youth, had incurred some debts, on
account of which he had retired from fashionable life on about 200l. per
annum, and had not been heard of for some years. This nephew was the
identical Mr. Jones, the hero of our story, who now took possession of
the house, title, and estate, and is the present earl of Exeter!</p>

<h4>A PLEASING REVERIE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Conducted</span> by
Contemplation, I found myself in the fertile regions of Imagination;
Genius and Education had dispersed those mists which are the offspring
of Prejudice. My soul, seized with the fire of Enthusiasm, took her
flight to scenes which mortals have not yet dared to explore.
I&nbsp;penetrated the inmost recesses of the temple of that Virtue, by
the exercise of whose attributes mortals are almost elevated to the
mighty inhabitants of heaven. At the porch of this edifice stood
blooming Temperance, and meek Religion with uplifted eye. At the feet of
Temperance laid grovelling Austerity, accompanied with the meagre crowd
of penitential Fasts. Cloathed in black, at the feet of Religion,
appeared Superstition, with her attendants, Folly, Enthusiasm, and
Hypocrisy. In vain they endeavoured to enter the temple of Virtue;
Temperance and Religion united, stood the shock of their numberless
hosts! Having passed the porch, my divine guide left me to the care of
Liberality of Mind: “You heed not my advice; follow her dictates and
they will assuredly conduct thee to Virtue.” As we proceeded, Liberality
of Mind made me acquainted with the names of these moral virtues by
whose aid the throne of the goddess is ascended. “He who perpetually
points to the divine throne, is Philosophy. He unfolds the various
secrets of nature, which are hid from the ignorant. Before him is
Contemplation; and behind him, Imagination, who has given birth to
<span class = "pagenum">231b</span>
so many hypotheses. See Fortitude, with her eye of fire, disdaining
every allurement the earth affords: after whom follows Resignation to
the will of Providence; and here, behold&mdash;&mdash;” I&nbsp;now saw
Virtue enthroned; with Benevolence one side, and on the other that
celestial power who teaches men to controul their mortal passions.
Virtue’s glory did not blaze forth; her fire was that which burnt
continually the same equal flame; unlike the glare of vice, which
greatly blazes forth for the moment, but soon leaves us in eternal
darkness!</p>

<h4><span class = "giant">SATIRE</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">General</span> satyrists
are usually tinctured with a degree of misanthropy; they dislike the
species for the faults of individuals, and they attribute to the whole,
what is due only to a small portion of mankind. This talent of prying
into the infirmities of human nature, is frequently useful to the
public; it is always inconvenient to the possessor; it corrects the
vanity, the affectation, and the vices of other men, but it breeds
conceit, pride, obstinacy and peevishness in the mind of the owner.
Though it maybe founded on good sense, it destroys the best fruits of
that invaluable blessing<span class = "locked">---</span>self-happiness.
One cannot declaim against the world without dreading some retribution;
the satirist in the full career of triumph, trembles at the thoughts of
being hated by those he pretends to despise, and he commonly meets with
that contempt which he so liberally bestows.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">To</span> review the
transactions of former days, the many sportive hours which have long
been past, and to recall the pleasures of innocence and virtue, is both
pleasing and instructive; pleasing, because it delights the heart with
joys it once participated, and of which, while animated with the
prospect, tho’ only the delusive paintings of imagination, it seems even
now to partake; instructive, because it presents our progress in
happiness and virtue, or the mournful reverse our deviation from
innocence and rectitude. But it is particularly pleasing to look back on
the scenes of youth and childhood; we review those seasons of life with
the greatest partiality and delight. ’Twas then health and beauty
bloomed upon the cheek, and every object was decked with the charms of
fascination. ’Twas then the heart ignorant of vice and unacquainted with
sorrow or misfortune, enjoyed every pleasure without alloy. There are
likewise other parts of life which occupy the moment of reflection: the
learned dwell with rapture on the hours spent in the acquirement of
knowledge and instruction, the ambitious on their gradual progression to
wealth and fame, and the brave on the many dangers and hardships they
have undergone in the field of battle. Reflection is especially the
attendant of age, it assists to enliven the many vacant hours which are
common at this period. The aged almost feel their strength renewed in
recounting their former seats of activity, and their hearts are animated
by the virtuous deeds they have performed.</p>

<p>Happy then is he who having spent his days in the practice of every
public and social virtue, reviews the past actions of his life with
chearfulness and content: the pleasures of reflection shall chear the
listless moments of decrepitude and age, and shall convey peace and
comfort to his bosom in those moments when present enjoyments
<span class = "pagenum">233b</span>
have lost their relish. Tho’ he no more can perceive the splendour of
the sun, and the various beauties of creation: tho’ incapable of hearing
the most harmonious music, and of enjoying the choicest delicacies;
still shall the power of his mind survive the general ruin, and
reflection chear him in the evening of his days.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Among</span> the different
conditions and ranks of men, the balance of happiness is preserved in a
great measure equal; and the high and low, the rich and the poor,
approach in point of real enjoyment much nearer to each other than is
commonly imagined. Providence never intended that any state here should
either be completely happy, or entirely miserable.</p>

<p>If the feelings of pleasure are more numerous and more lively, in the
higher departments of life, such also are those of pain. If greatness
flatters our vanity, it multiplies our dangers.&mdash;If opulence
increases our gratifications, it increases in the same proportion our
desires and demands.&mdash;If the poor are confined to a more narrow
circle, yet within that circle lie most <ins class = "correction" title

all the refinements of art, are found to be the most genuine and true.
For the happiness of every man depends more upon the state of his own
mind than upon any one external circumstance; nay, more than upon all
external things put together.</p>

<p>Inordinate passions are the great disturbers of life; and unless we
possess a good conscience, and a well governed mind, discontent will
blast every enjoyment, and the highest prosperity will only prove
disgusted misery. This conclusion then would be fixed in the mind: The
destruction of virtue is the destruction of peace. In no station<span

<p>“Very strange!” the Duke replied, shaking his head; “the Irishman has
said much the same, and nevertheless, he hit upon an expedient of
proving to me the possibility of apparitions.”</p>

<p>“I have read that argument; it is taken from the dialectic. This
circumstance alone ought to have made you suspect it. Or are you such a
novice in that science that you should not know how pliable it is to
accommodate itself to all opinions? Those philosophers who fancy all the
beings of the whole creation to be spirits, as well as those who deny
the existence of God, draw their arguments from that source. Is there
any absurdity that could not be fitted to that baseless philosophy?”</p>

<p>“You are carrying matters too far. The Irishman did indeed propound
several positions, which by their evidence enforce their claim to
truth.”</p>

<p>“That I do not deny. A great deal of philosophical penetration is
however required, if one shall be able to discern the truth and
falsehood, which its assertion imply in a strange and m One feels
indeed, frequently, the falsehood of sophistical subtilities without
being able to refute them.”</p>

<p>“I should be glad to know what you have to object against the
doctrine of the Irishman concerning the possibility of apparitions<ins
class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">?”</ins></p>

<p>“In order to do this, it will be necessary previously to abstract his
doctrine.</p>

<p>“When a spirit, the Irishman says, operates on mine, then he is
present to me. If I were a mere rational being, I&nbsp;then should be
satisfied with <i>imagining</i> the presence of the spirit,
<i>without</i> myself; but since I am a sensible being, by virtue of my
nature, my imagination forms a corporeal idea of the object which my
understanding <i>thinks</i>; that is, it forms an image of it. The
presence of a spirit, therefore, puts my inferior intellectual powers in
motion by means of the superior
<span class = "pagenum">234b</span>
ones; I&nbsp;do not only imagine it merely without myself, but I
perceive, at the same time, a&nbsp;shape answerable to it; I&nbsp;not
only collect the ideas which he produces in my mind, but, at the same
time, shape them in words. In short, I&nbsp;see the spirit and hear him
speak.&mdash;Do you think, my friend, that I have comprehended the
doctrine of the Irishman?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly!”</p>

<p>“The shape in which I see the spirit is, consequently, no real
substance, but only the product of my sensitive power of perception, of
my imagination.”</p>

<p>“Very right.”</p>

<p>“Consequently, the seeing of a spirit is, indeed, founded on a
spiritual influx, which, however, is formed and shaped at pleasure by
our imagination; therefore, on every apparition of spirits truth would
be intermixed with illusion, and the notions which have been instilled
in our mind by our education, and all the prejudices we have imbibed in
our infancy, would act an important part on every occasion of that
kind?”</p>

<p>“I perceive what you are aiming at.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me, what would the gift of seeing spirits and ghosts
benefit us, since the spiritual effect could not but be interwoven so
closely with the phantoms of our imagination, that it would be
impossible to discern reality from the gross illusions which it is
surrounded with?”</p>

<p>The Duke was absorbed in silent meditation, and I continued:<span
class = "locked">---</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you see that <i>superstition</i> thus would be at full liberty
to exercise its sway over us, because we would be led to believe that
even the most absurd delusions of our imagination <i>could possibly</i>
be founded on a spiritual influx?”</p>

<p>The Duke continued to be silent, and I resumed.&mdash;</p>

<p>“And don’t you see that it would be impossible to discern a
ghost-seer from a lunatic?”</p>

<p><ins class = "correction"
title = "text has superfluous open quote">The</ins> Duke started up<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has superfluous close quote">: </ins>“How, from a lunatic?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. The characteristic of lunacy consists in mistaking mere
objects of the imagination for real substances, existing without
ourselves, the original cause of which is a convulsion of the vessels of
our brain, which are put out of their equilibrium. This suspension of
the equilibrium can arise either from weakness of nerves, or from too
strong a pressure of the blood towards the head, and mere phantoms of
our imagination then appear to us, even while awake, to be real objects
without ourselves. Although such an image should be but faint at first,
yet the consternation at such an apparition, so contrary to the natural
order of things, would soon excite the attention, and impart to the
phantom a vivacity that would not suffer the deluded person to doubt its
reality. It is therefore very natural; for the visionary fancies he sees
and hears very plainly, what no person besides him perceives, or
imagines he sees such phantoms appear and disappear suddenly, when they
are gamboling only before <i>one</i> sense that of <i>sight</i>, without
being perceived through another sense; for example, that of
<i>feeling</i>, and therefore appear to be penetrable. The
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page235" id = "page235">235</a></span>
distemper of the visionary does not affect the understanding
immediately, but only the senses; in consequence of which the unhappy
wretch cannot remove the delusion by arguments of reason, because the
real or supposed perception through the senses, always antecedes the
judgment of the understanding, and possesses an immediate evidence which
surpasses all reflection. For which reason I can blame no person who
treats the ghost-seers as candidates for the lunatic hospital, instead
of looking upon them as people belonging, partly, to another world.”</p>

<p>“Marquis, Marquis!” the Duke said, smiling, “you use the ghost-seers
very ill. I&nbsp;should leave them entirely at your mercy, if the
Irishman had not promised to communicate to me a criterion by which one
can discern real apparitions from vain phantoms of the imagination.”</p>

<p>“It is a pity he has only promised it, it being probable that this
promise will not be performed with greater punctuality than the rest of
his engagements.”</p>

<p>“The event will prove how much you wrong him.”</p>

<p>“But what would you say, if I could prove that he can communicate to
you no criterion of that nature?”</p>

<p>“If you could do this---”</p>

<p>“Nothing is easier. The criterion whereby a real apparition of a
ghost could be discerned from an illusion, must be either external or
internal: that is, you must be able to ascertain the presence of a
ghost, either by means of your senses, or by conclusions deduced from
the impression your mind receives. Don’t you think&nbsp;so?”</p>

<p>“It would be much safer if these two criterions co-existed.”</p>

<p>“It would be sufficient if only one of these two criterions were
possible. However, you shall soon be convinced that neither can be
proved. Whatever you perceive, or suppose you perceive by means of your
senses, in case of an apparition, is either a real material object,
whereby perhaps an impostor, perhaps nature, who is so inexhaustable in
her effects, or an accidental meeting of uncommon incidents surprises
you; or it is an object that exists no where but in your heated
imagination; what you perceive through your senses never can be the
spirit himself, because spirits are incorporeal beings, and therefore
neither can be seen, heard, nor felt; it is, consequently, evident that
no external criterion of the reality of an apparition can exist.”</p>

<p>“This, I think, cannot be disputed.”</p>

<p>“But there exists perhaps an internal criterion. In order to decide
this question, let us consider what passes in the human mind when a
ghost appears. First of all, a&nbsp;lively idea of the presence of a
ghost takes place, and sensations of terror, astonishment and awe
arise<span class = "locked">---</span>however, this idea and these
sensations may be nothing else but the consequence of an uncommon,
though natural external impression of a feverish fancy, and consequently
never can be indubitable proofs of the presence of spirits. But perhaps
the presence of spirits is ascertained by the co-existence of certain
extraordinary notions, sensations, and cognitions! This too cannot
<span class = "pagenum">235b</span>
be, for we must be convinced that they could not arise in our soul in a
natural manner, if we shall be able to ascertain their having been
produced by the influence of a spirit. In that case it would be
requisite we should know the whole store of our clear and obscure ideas,
all their reciprocal relations, and all possible compositions which our
imagination can form of them, a&nbsp;knowledge that is reserved only for
the omniscient Ruler of the world. If we happen sometimes, in our
dreams, to have the most wonderful visions, to reason in the most
sensible manner, to discover new truths, and to predict incidents which
afterwards really happen; why should not the same faculty of the soul
which produces such uncommon effects in our dreams, surprise us
sometimes with similar operations while we are awake, when it is
agitated in a violent manner? In short, my friend, there exists neither
an internal nor an external criterion whereby we could ascertain the
reality of an apparition.”</p>

<p>“O how insufficient is human reason!” the Duke groaned, “how
ambiguous the faculty through which we fancy we resemble the Godhead,
and that guides us much unsafer than instinct directs brutes. But a
short time since I thought it to be consonant with reason to believe in
apparitions of ghosts, and now I am convinced of the contrary. Your
arguments have pulled down what those of the Irishman have constructed,
and thus I am constantly driven from one belief to the opposite one.
Where shall I find, at length, a&nbsp;fixed point to rest upon? O! how
happy is he, who undisturbed by the restless instinct of thinking, and
of investigating the nature of things, rests in the lap of faith!”</p>

refinement and unaffected sensibility.</p>

<p>Mr. Alton, once amply possessed of the gifts of fortune, and
surrounded with every earthly blessing, suddenly left his weeping lady,
then pregnant, and an infant son, and fled from the pursuit of
justice.</p>

<p>He had violated the laws of religion, honour and his country, by
seducing from her duty the wife of his friend; a&nbsp;duel was the
consequence, and the injured husband lost his life in the fatal
rencounter.</p>

<p>Immediate flight was Mr. Alton’s only resource; therefore, regardless
of every feeling but such as arose for his own safety, he precipitately
left his native country, completely wretched, and loaded with all the
horrors of guilt and dismay.</p>

<p>A short time after his arrival in Italy, his means of support failed;
extravagance and dissipation had ruined his fortunes, and he must soon
have fled from importunate creditors, had not this still more dreadful
cause forced him from his wretched family.</p>

<p>As he had acquired the art of becoming fortunate at play, his talents
that way were now brought forward, and an uncommon run of success soon
enabled him to shine forth again in a foreign country with the same
splendour he once displayed in his own.</p>

<p>Again engaged in frivolous pursuits of expence and pleasure, his
light and worthless heart soon dismissed every trace of remorse for the
distress and anguish he had occasioned in the family of his murdered
friend, and the utter ruin brought on his deserted wife and
children.</p>

<p>Possessing every art of genteel address, an elegant person, assisted
with all the powers of soft persuasion, he soon (under the name of
Freeman, not daring to use his real one) won upon the heart of a young
lady of exalted birth, whom he privately married.</p>

<p>Her friends at first forbade them their presence, but the young and
beautiful Italian being a much-loved and only child, they soon yielded
to excuses and professions which
<span class = "pagenum">236b</span>
he too well knew how to frame, and at length received them to favour and
protection.</p>

<p>Many years passed on without a returning thought of former
connections he had heard long since, by private means, that his first
lady had fallen a victim to a broken heart, leaving the care of a son
and daughter to her afflicted father, who had little remaining to
support them, the necessities of the unprincipled and unfeeling Alton
having almost drained his once ample fortune.</p>

<p>And here it is necessary to inform the reader, that the poor old
gentleman did not long survive the loss of his child. But heaven raised
up a friend to her offspring: this friend, who delighted in acts of
mercy, adopted the two innocents, as his own, making over to them his
estate and <i>his name</i>.</p>

<p>A young gentleman of the name of Easton, often visited at Mr.
Freeman’s, whose house was always open to people of fashion; and though
their years did not correspond, yet the former still carried an
appearance of youth and gaiety, assisted by an uncommon share of health,
and a heart feelingly alive to every call of pleasure.</p>

<p>Alike dissolute in manners and inclination, an intimacy soon
commenced between them. The present Mrs. Freeman, who, before her
marriage, experienced every indulgence and attention from parents who
adored her, had too early an occasion to lament her misplaced love, and
unhappy choice.</p>

<p>Never, but in the hours of inebriation, did she experience any thing
like attention and kindness from the man who owed every thing to her.
Then, indeed, he would utter rhapsodies of affection, alike destitute of
sincerity as of reason.</p>

<p>And now, their only child (a beautiful young lady who had just
attained her 13th year, the only companion of her pensive mother, to
whom she was indeed a real comfort, dutiful affection and endearing
sensibility having lightened many a painful day) was visited by a fever,
which robbed her afflicted parent of her sole remaining blessing. This
calamity deeply affected them both. The impression made on Mrs. Freeman
brought on a decline, which proved fatal&mdash;bereft of every earthly
happiness, she looked up to that heaven she had been long preparing for,
and in a short time obtained dismission from a world, from which she had
been weaned by trouble, and the unkind neglect of a husband she had
loved but too well.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman put on the outward “trappings and the suits of
woe”&mdash;but wanted “that within,” which goes beyond every external
appearance.</p>

<p>Pomp and parade, indeed, attended her remains to the silent tomb; but
these were not accompanied with the husband’s tear. The monument was
raised on which his sorrows were recorded, but, cold and senseless as
the marble which received that record, his heart was a stranger to those
feelings that dignify the husband, the father, and the man.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> first instant I
could retire, I retreated to my chamber, my mind embarrassed with the
cruelest sensations: grief and astonishment at his mean situation.
I&nbsp;wished, yet durst not go to the garden; unconscious of art,
I&nbsp;feared I might betray unguardedly the too fond sentiments of my
soul. The next day my maid brought me a beautious bouquet; she said the
gardener had culled it from the choicest of his flowers<span class =

was rolled round, a&nbsp;presentiment struck me it might contain
something interesting==I hastily tore it from the flowers, and read the
following lines:</p>

<p>“Will the loveliest of her sex pardon the presumption of an
unfortunate man, the early victim of calamity?==will she deign to peruse
a relation of those woes which have reduced him to the disgraceful
station he now fills==an irresistible impulse prompts this request; if
’tis granted, write a line and drop it in the garden==in expectation of
such a favour, I&nbsp;will keep in sight, and then by the first
opportunity transmit my narrative to you.”</p>

<p>Tears gushed from me on perusing this note, heavens! what anguish
rent my breast at my inability to succour him. Without the smallest
hesitation, I&nbsp;complied with his request, and instantly wrote the
note he desired. The next day, concealed in a basket of fruit which he
sent me, I&nbsp;found the ardently desired paquet, containing the
history of his life.</p>

<p>“Prompted by an inclination not to be supprest, I sit down to relate
a tale full of woe to her, whose gentle heart will yield the soft
tribute of sensibility.</p>

<p>“Early in life fortune loured on my parents, and their misfortunes
are, I&nbsp;fear, entailed upon their wretched offspring. My father’s
name was Harland, he was descended from a noble family, whose
possessions tho’ large, could keep no pace with unbounded prodigality;
the fortune was so dissipated, that but a residue remained sufficient to
purchase him a commission. Courage glowed in his breast and he
distinguished himself by many a gallant action in a tedious war which
England undertook against France. At the expiration of it he married a
woman, rich only in rectitude and beauty, and retired from a profession
which had but ill rewarded his activity. For some time they struggled
against adversity<span class = "locked">---</span>the fell adversary at
length overcame. Two children of whom I was the eldest, aggravated the
horrors of their condition; he could scarcely support them, as his
half-pay afforded but a few of even the necessaries of life. In this
situation he was discovered by a friend, possessed of affluence, who was
single; as he had always exprest an aversion to matrimony, he inherited
pride enough however to wish his name might be continued. Actuated by
this wish, he made a proposal to my parents which they gladly
embraced<span class = "locked">---</span>it was adopting me for his
heir. I&nbsp;was then five years old,
<span class = "pagenum">237b</span>
he shortly brought me to his estate for he had only made an occasional
visit to the shire where my father resided; his understanding was rather
weak, his chief foible a credulous susceptibility to flattery; he
treated me however, with tenderness, and I was considered by every one
as his future heir. At a proper age, he sent me to Oxford to complete my
studies; I&nbsp;made a proficiency there that pleased him, and he
declared I should be indulged in chusing a profession. Every vacation I
spent with him. In one, ere I was an hour arrived, he mentioned with
peculiar pleasure an acquisition his neighbourhood had lately received
from a most agreeable family settling in it. Mr. and Mrs. Wilford with
their two sons, he affirmed, I&nbsp;should like; but he was mistaken,
a&nbsp;servility ran thro’ the family highly disgusting to a liberal
mind; I&nbsp;found them all replete with flattery and meanness.
A&nbsp;domestic who had ever evinced the strongest partiality for me,
cautioned me against them; he said he was acquainted with their arts,
and bid me beware, as they were almost continually with his master,
wheedling and indulging his favourite foible. Unskilled in the treachery
of man, I&nbsp;neglected this caution, I&nbsp;judged of them by myself,
I&nbsp;imagined them all as free from guile. Fatal experience however,
that school of wisdom, undeceived me. I&nbsp;thought also it was
impossible any person could be so perfidious, as after promising
protection, to withdraw it without cause. Mr. <span class =
"locked">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> convinced me such perfidy existed. By
the next vacation my studies were completed, and I returned full of
pleasing expectations, that my adopted father would now indulge me in
chusing a profession, which of all others I admired<ins class =
"correction" title = "punctuation missing">&mdash;</ins>a&nbsp;military
life, for like Douglas, I&nbsp;longed to follow to the field some
warlike lord.</p>

<p>“Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;’s reception surprized me, it was cold and
reserved; whenever his eyes met mine, a&nbsp;guilty confusion covered
his face. Base, worthless man! no wonder. Two days after my arrival, he
sent for me to his library, for some moments he was silent, then in
hesitating accents began a long preamble of his generosity to my father,
in so long supporting me, and giving me an education suitable to the
first man in the kingdom, of which he supposed I must be sensible; an
assenting bow was my only reply: and he continued: his relations, he
said, began with justice to murmer, at the intention he had conceived of
bequeathing me his fortune, to whom no tie connected him, that he had
discarded the idle idea of adopting me, and added, my education was such
as to inspire me with hopes of a speedy establishment; to forward which,
he would give two hundred pounds, and on every occasion I might depend
upon his friendly interest. He stopt; amazement harrowed my soul, and
indignation tied my tongue. But on repeating his words, and offering me
the money, I&nbsp;dashed it from his hand, and in a phrenzy of fury
rushed from the house. I&nbsp;guessed full well the authors of my
misery, the vile Wilfords, who, in my absence, by the most servile arts,
ingratiated themselves with Mr. <span class =
"locked">T&mdash;&mdash;</span>. He abandoned me for their sons. Hours I
continued walking about his demesne almost unconscious of my being; the
insult I had received, the disappointment of all my hopes was too much
for a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page238" id = "page238">238</a></span>
naturally impetuous temper. When reason a little calmed my passion,
I&nbsp;resolved immediately to repair to my parents. I&nbsp;had not seen
them since my infancy, though my wishes to behold them were great. Mr.
<span class = "locked">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> always prevented my
gratifying them, as they lived at an extreme distance from him. Nothing
will intimidate a youthful mind when bent on executing a favourite
project; on foot, therefore, without consideration, I&nbsp;began my
journey; no pleasing thoughts soothed my breast or beguiled the tedious
way. The third day I conjectured I must be pretty near their habitation;
filial piety sprung in my breast and quickened my steps at the idea;
a&nbsp;pleasing calm diffused itself over my soul in anticipating the
rapture of the paternal embrace<span class =
"locked">---</span>a&nbsp;dusky hue was beginning to steal along the
expanse, and sober evening had taken ‘her wonted station in the middle
air.’</p>

Church-yard lay on one side of the road, and the only separation between
them was a slight broom hedge. I&nbsp;thought I heard the plaintive
voice of woe. I&nbsp;looked and discerned a venerable man, whose figure
must have moved even the sullen apathy of the stoic. He was seated on a
new-made grave&mdash;his grey locks displayed his age, and he appeared
bending beneath the pressure of misfortune&mdash;his eyes were now
watering the grave, now cast up to heaven, with a settled look of
despair. I&nbsp;could not pass him unnoticed&mdash;I entered this
mournful receptacle of death&mdash;too much absorbed, he had not heeded
me, till a sigh burst from my oppressed heart. Without starting, he
raised his head, and cried, who seeks this dreary spot?&mdash;One,
I&nbsp;replied, pierced by adversity, who is hastening to a parent’s
bosom, where his wounds may receive the balm of consolation. Struck by
your distress, I&nbsp;could not pass you, a&nbsp;secret impulse rose in
my soul, I&nbsp;wished to hear your woes. Alas! young man, he answered,
my woes are of the severest kind. I&nbsp;indulged hope, I&nbsp;listened
to its idle prattle, I&nbsp;thought to have spent the remnant of my days
in peace&mdash;but the shafts of affliction were let loose against

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> Emperor being at
supper at Paris, with Count de Vergennes, the French minister, and
discoursing of French affairs, he advised the Count to announce a
national bankruptcy, in order to clear France of all her debts: to this
he was answered<span class = "locked">---</span>“Should such an event
take place, your Majesty’s own subjects in Brabant would lose more than
eighty millions.” “Do not let that deter you (answered Joseph,) give me
half that sum, and you shall have my assent.”</p>

<p>At the time of the affair with the Dutch concerning the Schelt, which
terminated so shamefully for Joseph, talking with his head gardner, the
gardner asked permission to write to Haarlem for a few slips of flowers,
which he wanted. The Emperor started from his seat; his eyes flashing
fire==“No, said he, you shall not write. Within six weeks I will fetch
them myself from Haarlem, at the head of my army.” Within that time the
affair was finished with disgrace. So positive was he of success, and so
sure always to fail.</p>

<h4>THE PIEDMONTESE SHARPER.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> the year 1695, a
Piedmontese, who stiled himself Count Caraffa, came to Vienna, and
privately waited on the prime minister, pretending he was sent by the
duke of Savoy on a very important affair, which they two were to
negotiate without the privity of the French court. At the same time he
produced his credentials, in which the duke’s seal and signature were
very exactly imitated. He met with a very favourable reception, and,
without affecting any privacy, took upon him the title of envoy
extraordinary from the court of Savoy. He had several conferences with
the imperial council, and made so great a figure in the most
distinguished assemblies, that once at a private concert at court, the
captain of the guard, denying him admittance, he demanded satisfaction
in his master’s name, and the officer was obliged to ask his pardon. His
first care was to ingratiate himself with the jesuits, who at that time
bore a great sway at court; and in order <ins class = "correction" title
= "text unchanged: missing word?">to this</ins>, he went to visit their
church, which remained unfinished, they pretended from the low
circumstances of the society, he asked them how much money would
complete it. An estimate to the amount of two thousand louis-d’ors being
laid before him, Caraffa assured them of his constant attachment to
their order; that he had gladly embraced such a public opportunity of
shewing his esteem for them, and that they might immediately proceed to
finishing their church. In consequence of his promise, he sent that very
day the two thousand louis-d’ors, at which sum the charge had been
computed.</p>

<p>He was very sensible this was a part he could not act long without
being detected; and that this piece of generosity might not be at his
own expence, he invited a great number of ladies of the first rank to
supper and a ball. Every one of the guests had promised to be there; but
he complained to them all of the ill returns made to his civilities,
adding, that he had been often disappointed, as the ladies made no
scruple of breaking their word on such occasions, and, in a jocular way,
insisted on a pledge from every lady for their appearance at the time
appointed. One gave him a ring, another a pearl necklace, a&nbsp;third a
pair of earings, a&nbsp;fourth a gold watch, and several such trinkets,
to the amount of twelve thousand dollars.
<span class = "pagenum">241b</span>
On the evening appointed not one of the guests were missing; but it may
easily be conceived, what a damp it struck upon the whole assembly, when
it was at last found that the gay Piedmontese was a sharper, and had
disappeared. Nor had the jesuits any great reason to applaud themselves
on the success of their dissimulation; for a few days before his
departure, the pretended count, putting on an air of deep concern,
placed himself in the way of the emperor’s confessor, who inquiring into
the cause of his apparent melancholy, he intrusted him with the
important secret, that he was short of money at a juncture when eight
thousand louis-d’ors were immediately wanted for his master’s affairs,
to be distributed at the imperial court. The jesuits, to whom he had
given a recent instance of his liberality by so large a donation,
immediately furnished him with the sum he wanted; and with this
acquisition, and the ladies pledges, he thought he had carried his jests
far enough, and very prudently withdrew from Vienna.</p>

<h4>ALMANZOR, THE ARABIAN.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> great Almanzor,
as he is called, to distinguish him from some other Arabian princes of
his name, was king of Cordova, in Spain. He was no less famous for his
wisdom than for his courage; he wrote a book of maxims, from which these
that follow are taken.</p>

<p>“If hungry beggars are whipt through the streets, beggars in fine
cloaths have a right to their proportion of notice, and should be sent
to the gallies.</p>

<p>“Pride is as true a beggar, very often, as poverty can be, but a good
deal more saucy.</p>

<p>“A prince who resolves to do no good, unless he can do every thing,
teaches his people to see that they are slaves, and they have a right to
do whatever they have a mind&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>“Power and liberty are like heat and moisture; when they are well
mixed, every thing prospers; when they are single, they ever do
mischief.</p>

<p>“I believe the least useful part of the people have the most credit
with the prince. Men will conclude therefore, that to get every thing,
it is necessary to be good for nothing.”</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I had</span> not yet
recovered from my astonishment at the speech of the Duke, when Alumbrado
asked me, after a short pause:</p>

<p>“Then you think it absurd to believe in the possibility of
apparitions?”</p>

<p>“A belief that has no firm foundation is absurd.”</p>

<p>“You then think every apparition, however it be shaped&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is delusion, the source of which arises either from external natural
causes, or flows from our bewildered imagination, or from both at
once.”</p>

<p>“One question more!” the Duke said, “What do you think of the occult
wisdom which Hiermanfor is said to have learnt from the Bramins?”</p>

<p>“That it consists in a profound knowledge of physic and natural
history.”</p>

<p>“And the supernatural power he is boasting of&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Is nothing but a skilful application of that knowledge!”</p>

<p>The Duke remained silent for some time, and then resumed:</p>

<p>“You think it impossible for mortals to acquire a supernatural
power?”</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>“It seems you deny also the possibility of miracles?” Alumbrado said
with a dreadful look, which he however soon sweetened again.</p>

<p>“I am convinced of the possibility of miracles,” I replied, “because
it is self-evident that God, who is the author of the laws of nature,
can alter and suspend them; but this only the Creator can do; man,
consequently, is not capable of working miracles.”</p>

<p>“But men can become instruments in the hand of God,” Alumbrado
continued, “whereby Providence performs miracles!”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, but no wretches like the Irishman. The eternal source
of truth and holiness can never employ, as an immediate instrument, an
impostor who deals in lies and artifice.”</p>

<p>“Where will you find a mortal without fault?” the Duke said, “indeed
you are too much prejudiced against the Irishman. He did not deceive me
out of malice or selfishness, but only for the sake of a just and noble
purpose.”</p>

<p>“Actions that are in themselves immoral, like imposition and lies,
never can be rendered moral by the justness of their end, and an organ
of the Godhead never can employ means of so culpable a nature. But, my
friend, if you really are persuaded the furtherance of the revolution to
have been a noble and just action, why has the Irishman been obliged to
exert all his arts to prevail on you to assist in the execution of that
undertaking?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">242b</span>
<p>The Duke cast his eyes to the ground, and Alumbrado left us. Miguel
seemed to be penetrated with shame and confusion, and continued for some
time to keep his eyes rivetted to the ground without uttering a
word.</p>

<p>I took him affectionately by the hand: “It was not my intention to
tell you my opinion of your adventures with the Irishman in Alumbrado’s
presence; you have forced me to do it, and I could not help telling my
<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘mi_n’">mind</ins>
freely.”</p>

<p>“I thank you for it.”</p>

<p>“Your obstinacy and my frankness may prove fatal to me.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“It will perhaps cost me my life and liberty.”</p>

<p>“I do not comprehend you.”</p>

<p>“I have declared myself against the belief in apparitions, and
Alumbrado is perhaps at present on the road to the inquisition, in order
to inform against&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“Have you not yet conquered your prejudices against him? Don’t be
uneasy, and cease judging unjustly of a man against whom you have no
reason of complaint, except a countenance you do not like.”</p>

<p>“You did not observe the fiend-like look he darted at me. O my
friend, whatever may befall me, I&nbsp;will submit willingly to it, if I
have succeeded in recalling you from your errors!”</p>

<p>“I thank you for your love, but I apprehend very much I am one of
those unhappy men of whom you have been saying, that no arguments of
reason can remove their delusion. I&nbsp;am sensible that my <ins class
= "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for sensation">sensations</ins> has an immediate evidence, which overpowers
every persuasion of the understanding<span class =
"locked">---</span>this I am sensible of, as often as I recall to my
mind the apparition at the church-yard.”</p>

<p>“You view me with looks of pity,” the Duke continued, after a short
pause, “I&nbsp;divine your thoughts. However, if you had seen what I
have witnessed<span class = "locked">---</span>”</p>

<p>“Then I should have been astonished at the artful delusion, and the
dexterity of the Irishman.”</p>

<p>“And at the same time would not have been able to conceive, as well
as myself, how it could have been performed in a natural manner.”</p>

<p>“I grant it; but I never conclude that any thing has been performed
by supernatural means, because I cannot comprehend how it could have
been effected in a natural manner. These was a time when you fancied the
apparition in Amelia’s apartment to have been effected by supernatural
means, and yet it was not so. Who would have the childish arrogance to
fancy his intellectual faculties to be the scale of the powers of
nature, and his knowledge the limit of human art? However, the
apparition of the church-yard has some defects, which its author could
not efface in spite of his dexterity, and which easily would have
dispelled the delusion before the eyes of a cool observer. The Irishman
could not give to the phantom the accent of Antonio’s voice, how
skilfully soever he imitated his features. That the apparition did not
move his eyes and lips, nor any limb, is also a suspicious circumstance,
that proves the limits of the artificer’s skill. But what renders the
reality of the apparition
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page243" id = "page243">243</a></span>
most suspicious is, undoubtedly, your friend’s ignorance of what his
pretended spirit (consequently his proper self) told you at the
church-yard; for if he had known any thing of it, he would not have
concealed it from the Prince of Braganza, in whose arms he died, much
less from you, in his farewell letter. Finally, if you consider what
your tutor has told the Prince about his statue, which has been cut in
wood during his imprisonment, you will find it very probable that the
Irishman has made use of it in some manner or other for effecting that
delusion.”</p>

<p>The Duke stared at me like a person suddenly roused from a profound
sleep.&mdash;“Marquis!” he said, at length, “you have opened my eyes;
but my unwont looks are unable to penetrate another fact I cannot expel
from my memory.”</p>

<p>“Again, an apparition&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Which, however, did not happen to me, but to my father.”</p>

<p>“You mean the apparition of Count San*?”</p>

<p>“The very same.”</p>

<p>“Your father has related to me all the particulars of it; I have
reflected upon it, and imagine I am capable of explaining it in a
natural manner. Your father received, two days before the ghost appeared
to him, a&nbsp;letter, by which he was informed that the Count was
dangerously ill, and that his life was despaired of on account of his
advanced age. This intelligence affected him violently, and the idea of
the impending dissolution of his dearest friend, prevailed in his mind
from that moment. The melancholy of your father seemed to encrease
hourly, reduced him in the day to the state of a dreaming person, and
disturbed his rest at night. As often us he awoke in the second night,
he fancied he heard somebody groan, yet the groaning person was
undoubtedly nobody but himself, and the cause of his groans originated
from the pressure of the blood against the breast. This pressure
awakened him once more, early in the morning, with some violence; he
fell again asleep a few minutes after, and it was very natural that the
object of the dream that stole upon him should be no other but Count
San*. Your father mistook that dream for a real apparition, and nothing
is more pardonable than this self-deceit. The only circumstance that
renders this incident remarkable, is, that the Count really expired in
that very hour. However, I&nbsp;ask you whether it be so very strange,
if our imagination, which deceives us so many thousand times by its
delusions, should at length coincide once accidentally with the
truth?”</p>

<p>“One rather ought to wonder,” the Duke replied, “that this is so
rarely the case.”</p>

<p>“Here you have two instances of apparitions,” I resumed, “which agree
in their being delusions, only with that difference, that one of them
which happened at the church-yard originated from external causes, and
the other from the imagination of your father. We are not always so
fortunate as to be able to explain apparitions in so natural a manner;
our incapacity and ignorance gives us, however, no right to think that
they are supernatural.”</p>

<p>“You think then that the belief in apparitions and the influence of
spirits originates merely from ignorance?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">243b</span>
<p>“Certainly; when man was yet in his unpolished state, and ignorant of
the laws of nature and of thinking, the uncivilized mortals could not
but observe many external phenomena which they could not explain, their
stock of experimental knowledge not being equal to that task.
Necessitated by the law of reason to search for the cause of every
effect, they substituted unknown causes, when unable to find out any
that were known to them, and mistook these powers for spirits, because
they were invisible to them, though they perceived their effects.”</p>

<p>“I do not deny, my friend, that the original source of the belief in
apparitions, and the influence of spirits, has taken its rise from an
evidently false conclusion. It has however been frequently the fate of
truth, that its discovery was founded on erroneous premises;
consequently the manner in which an idea is generated cannot render its
internal truth suspected, provided it be supported by other valid
arguments.”</p>

<p>“Your remark is very just and true, yet it cannot be applied to the
present case, for I have already proved that we possess neither an
external nor an internal criterion by which we could discern the
influence and apparition of those invisible beings, and that we
consequently have no sufficient reason to believe in their existence.
This too I will not contest. You have, however, proved only the
impossibility of finding out a criterion by which we could discern the
real influence of spirits, but not the impossibility of that influence
itself. It may yet be supposed that these beings can produce apparitions
without, and effects within ourselves, and that we are connected with
them in an effectual and secret manner. While this internal
impossibility is not proved, it will not be absurd to imagine that men
who mortify their sensuality, who are entirely absorbed in meditation,
and fix their looks merely on super-terrestial things, may be favoured
more frequently with the influence of spiritual beings, and a more
intimate connection with them.”</p>

<h4>ANECDOTE OF MR. FERGUSON.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> following story
Mr. Ferguson used frequently to repeat: He had finished the picture of a
handsome young lady, whose numerous friends, though they commended the
piece, found each some small faults, they thought might be corrected,
which would render the likeness complete. Mr. Ferguson, when informed of
it, desired they all might meet him at a certain hour, and being
properly placed, with his pallet and brushes in his hand, the picture
before him, and the lady sitting in a just light, he begged to be
favoured with the opinions and objections of the company present, one by
one; he acquiesced with them all, and put himself in a posture to remedy
the defects, pointed out. When he had gone through the whole he turned
the picture towards them, and every one pronounced it so finished a
piece, and so perfect a likeness, that it could not be improved. He then
requested them to examine both the pencils and canvass, which had been
all along perfectly dry, and left them to draw their own
conclusions.</p>

(Continued from our last.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">As</span> I mean to banish
prolixity from my narrative, I shall not mention the emotions this tale
excited when next we met. I&nbsp;could not help lamenting my utter
inability to aid his distress. A&nbsp;glow of grateful feelings
brightened his countenance. He caught my hand. Angelic sweetness, he
cried<span class = "locked">---</span>your face, how true an index of
your mind. In short, both strangers to dissimulation, we soon perceived
a passion, ardent, sincere, and reciprocal. We loved with all the
romantic enthusiasm of youth, forgetting the insuperable barriers
between us. We indulged our tenderness till it grew too great to be
subdued. Sitting together one afternoon, planning future days of bliss,
my hand locked in his, my soul beaming from my eyes, we suddenly heard a
rustling among some trees behind us, and my father instantly rushed out,
rage flashing from every glance. Frantic, he tore me from Harland, and
bid him begone, as he durst not answer for what he might be tempted to
do. Harland hesitated. I&nbsp;saw passion kindling in his eyes.
Terrified at the consequences which might ensue, I&nbsp;had just power
to articulate, obey him, oh obey him. My father loaded me with every
violent invective rage could suggest. To exculpate myself from the
meanness he accused me of, I&nbsp;divulged Harland’s history, but he
believed it not. He said it was a vile, artful tale, calculated to
deceive my unsuspecting youth, and lead me into a connection which he
would eternally have cursed me for. Good heaven! how my soul shuddered
at these words. For three days I gave myself up to immoderate grief; the
fourth, walking in an avenue cut through the wood, I&nbsp;saw a little
boy playing before me, I&nbsp;heeded him not, till I perceived him drop
a piece of paper, give me a significant sign, and run off. I&nbsp;flew
forward hastily, snatched it up, and retired to a chamber, where I read
the following lines from my unfortunate Harland:</p>

<p>“Oh, my Julia! what a cruel separation! Thus torn from thee, it fills
me with anguish&mdash;my only comfort thy society, deprived of that
too<span class = "locked">---</span>merciless fortune! I&nbsp;am
incoherent<span class = "locked">---</span>I hardly know what I write.
Julia, to quit this spot, without bidding you adieu, is more than I can

parting interview<span class = "locked">---</span>to meet perhaps;
I&nbsp;can’t go on<span class = "locked">---</span>Oh Julia! grant my
last request.”</p>

<p>I determined to comply, but could not without my maid’s assistance.
I&nbsp;entrusted her, and she promised to assist me. When the family
were retired to rest, she conducted me down stairs, and opening a little
door which led into the wood, said she would there watch my return.</p>

forward, oh my Julia, he cried, what goodness, what condescension, but

sweetness. He regretted his separation; lamented his want of fortune;
now bid me for ever forget him; then assured me, without the chearing
idea of my love, life would be unsupportable. I&nbsp;wept, assured him
it was unalterable, that only with existence it would cease. The moment
arrived to separate. He sunk upon his knees, besought eternal blessings
on my head, tenderly embraced me, while his voice was stifled with the
emotions of his soul, and tore himself away. I&nbsp;tottered home, and
leaning on my maid, retired to my chamber, where I past the remainder of
the night in tears, and all the pangs of hopeless love. Shortly after
this, a&nbsp;gentleman arrived at the castle who was son to a deceased
friend of my father’s, his birth and fortune noble, but his manners
tainted with arrogance and ill-nature. He conceived a partiality for me.
Just powers, what has it not caused me! Sir George still dreading the
unfortunate Harland, encouraged it. He was also really desirous of
having me advantageously married. He compelled me to listen to Mordaunt;
and in short, not to dwell longer on this painful subject,
notwithstanding my prayers, my tears, my declaration of passion for
another, I&nbsp;was forced the altar. The horror of that moment I can’t
express; the image of Harland was continually before me; my broken vows;
his sufferings; his love; they almost bereft me of reason. Three days
after the fatal ceremony, sitting alone in my dressing-room, as the
gentlemen were out, I&nbsp;heard a carriage drive hastily to the door.
I&nbsp;imagined it was some obtrusive visitors who came to pay their
unwelcome compliments, when in an instant the door was thrown open, and
Harland entered, the smile of anticipating pleasure on his face. He
attempted to clasp me in his arms, but shrinking from them,
I&nbsp;endeavoured to fly from the room; he caught my hand and forcibly
withheld me; he looked amazed at my agitation. Speak to me, my adored
Julia, he cried, Oh why this distress?<span class =

come to claim your hand. Sir George cannot deny me now. What bliss! what
happiness in store for us. I&nbsp;could hear no more; I&nbsp;broke from
him, and in agony of soul rending misery, wrung my hands together. We
are ruined, exclaimed I, for ever wretched. Oh Harland! forgive me.
I&nbsp;am miserable, compulsive power has undone me. I&nbsp;am, oh
detest me not, already married. I&nbsp;might have gone on for ever<span
class = "locked">---</span>his senses seemed annihilated, a&nbsp;deadly
paleness overspread his face; I&nbsp;was terrified; I&nbsp;flew to him;
I&nbsp;attempted to take his hand; my touch revived him. He started from
me; base faithless woman; his lips quivered, and in a phrenzy of
disappointed passion he rushed out of the house. He left me on the verge
of distraction, but when a little composed, I&nbsp;revolved my conduct:
I&nbsp;considered it improper; I&nbsp;was now married; those tender
sensations for another man were criminal; my virtue was strong,
I&nbsp;determined to exert it; the lessons of my beloved mother recurred
to me. She often said, affliction was the purifier of our passions, it
refined the soul, and lifted to that infinite Almighty power in whose
hands the balm was held for healing the wounds received on this
spot.</p>

<p class = "center smaller">
(Continued from our last.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">As</span> the family of his
late consort were rich and powerful Mr. Freeman checked his libertine
pursuits for a time; but the strength of habit soon overcame the
dictates of prudence, and again he listened to the powerful calls of
vice and dissipation.</p>

<p>A few months after Mrs. Freeman’s death he informed his friend Easton
that he would introduce him to a young creature, lovely as imagination
could form. He owned that the connection between them, being only that
of sentiment, became rather troublesome; that she had denied him the
most distant favour, and, in tears, regretted her ever giving way to a
hopeless passion which had driven her from home, and subjected her to
dangers of every kind.</p>

<p>“I first saw,” he continued, “this foolish girl at the neighbouring
convent<span class = "locked">---</span>Her beauty charmed me;
I&nbsp;gained her attention, and held many conversations at the grate,
in the course of which she informed me that, disappointed in a love
affair, and to avoid a forced marriage, she had fled from her guardian,
and sought refuge in the convent.</p>

<p>“I need not tell you, Easton, how love-sick girls are wrought upon.
I&nbsp;found more sensibility than prudence&mdash;her sorrows subsided
as I artfully dropped an answering tear, accompanied with a well-feigned
emotion. I&nbsp;used every means which is common with us fellows of
intrigue, and at length gained her consent to suffer me to procure her
enlargement, on my promise of protection and friendship.</p>

<p>“Her remove from the convent was, with some difficulty and no small
degree of danger, effected; when, expecting my reward and urging her to
be kind, she wept, said I had deceived her, and thus addressed
me:&mdash;&mdash;‘Cease, Sir, to alarm, with professions of love,
a&nbsp;poor young creature that knows not where to fly. Ask me for my
friendship and esteem, and honour me with your’s, and I shall be as
happy as my fortunes will permit. I&nbsp;wished to cast myself on your
protection, from a confidence in your honour&mdash;I have done
it&mdash;betray not then, oh! betray not the trust reposed in you. If
you take a violent and cruel advantage of my situation, short will be
your pleasure&mdash;but lasting your pain. You will at once lose all the
respect I now bear you, and render me completely wretched: it is too
true I am in your power, but do not, oh! do not abuse that power, by
plunging a wretch, already almost lost, into infamy and perdition.’</p>

<p>“I give you her own words, Easton, for you will find her romantic in
the extreme, with all the airs of dignity and virtue about her.
I&nbsp;endeavoured all I could to comfort and compose her spirits, and
offered to write home to her guardian; but to this she would not
consent, as in such a case her <i>name</i> would be exposed. ‘If,’ said
she,
<span class = "pagenum">245b</span>
‘imputed guilt is to be my portion, let me, with life, lament the
effects of my imprudent flight&mdash;but there <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: missing word?">are, whom</ins>, my folly might
disgrace, should an unfeeling world cast a stigma upon me&mdash;know me,
therefore, only as&mdash;<i>the wretched Julia!</i>’</p>

<p>“Upon this I left her, fool enough to be somewhat affected, and what
she means to do I cannot tell; I&nbsp;had procured her an apartment in a
private part of the city, with a servant to attend her; but not finding
in me the father she expected, I&nbsp;have a strong idea that she means
to play me the slip and steal away without my knowledge, which would
prove a disappointment to both of&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>“For, Easton, as you are a fine fellow, and withal somewhat younger
than myself, as <i>I</i> cannot succeed, I&nbsp;think you might venture
a trial upon your own account.”</p>

<p>“A friendly proposal,” exclaimed Easton, “convey me to her, and what
love, gallantry, and fine speeches can effect, depend&nbsp;on.”</p>

<p>The agreement made, they proceeded to pay a visit to the unfortunate
young lady.</p>

<p>The servant having given in Mr. Freeman’s name, they were conducted
to her apartment. But oh! heaven! what horror seized the heart of Easton
on beholding&mdash;<i>his sister</i>! He had left her during his
travels, which had detained him two years, under the protection of her
guardian, a&nbsp;man of sordid ideas, little principle, and still less
humanity<span class = "locked">---</span>but who had cunning sufficient
to carry the appearance of every good quality, and, by the deepest
dissimulation, had prevailed on the worthy Mr. Easton, the gentleman who
had given these unhappy children his name and fortune, in his last
moments to submit to him the management of the estate bequeathed them
till the youth became of age, and his sister was disposed of in
marriage.</p>

<p>How he had performed the will of his dying friend, respecting the
young lady, the reader has, in part, been made acquainted with<span
class = "locked">---</span>it remains only to say, that, by his
forbidding the addresses of Mr. Harcourt, a&nbsp;young soldier, whose
heart was as honourable as his profession, and who sincerely loved her,
and encouraging the hopes of a wretch, worn out with infirmities and a
diseased mind, he forced the unhappy Julia to determine on flight. Her
Harcourt had been called to the field, where, by protecting his country
at the hazard of his life, it was not then in his power to defend her he
held dearer than his own existence.</p>

<p>For a time, overcome with mutual astonishment, they both remained
silent! At length Easton, relieved by tears, embracing the sister of his
heart, exclaiming, “And have bad principles and bad men brought me to
the brink of such perdition? But Heaven is just, and at the same moment
converts my erring heart, and restores me to an almost-lost sister, whom
my future care and affection shall protect from every snare of deep-laid
villany.”</p>

<p>Then turning to the confounded and abashed Freeman, he uttered, “As
for you, be warned by this interposition of Providence in favour of your
undeserving friend.<span class = "locked">---</span>
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page246" id = "page246">246</a></span>
Your years and your principles do not correspond. I&nbsp;had a father,
gay and volatile like yourself, whose wretched story I have heard, but
whose guilt has divided his children and him&mdash;perhaps<span class =
"locked">---</span>forever! Mournful, no doubt, has been his existence,
and, if no more, miserable his <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has superfluous close quote">end.</ins><span class =
"locked">---</span>But wherever he may wander, if yet alive, oh! my
sister! would not you rejoice with me in comforting his suffering heart,
and in return receive the blessings of our nameless and interdicted
parent?”</p>

<p>Hearing, with trembling limbs, this passionate address, Mr. Freeman
exclaims, “Who, who was your father?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” returned Easton, “he has lost his name in his crimes, which
drove him from his family and country<span class = "locked">---</span>an
outlawed murderer!”</p>

<p>For the first time, powerful conviction rushed on the heart of
Freeman! “Oh!” he exclaimed, “be more explicit, surely my children are
now before me<span class = "locked">---</span>nor fear nor fate shall
longer hide my name<span class = "locked">---</span>’Tis <i>Alton</i>!
the miserable <i>Alton</i>, now casts his wretched load of existence
before you.”&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;They both ran towards him, and
owning an interposing providence with tears of joy and gratitude, raised
their <i>long-lost parent</i>! who at once reclaimed, at once thankful
to mysterious Heaven, embraced <i>his children</i>!</p>

<p>It only remains to inform the reader, that the father, with his son
and daughter, took shipping for England. An honourable peace soon
brought home to love and fortune the generous Harcourt, who was at
length united to his faithful Julia.</p>

<p>The old guardian had paid the debt of nature, and, struck with a
check of conscience, he not only left the whole estate of the late Mr.
Easton, unimpaired, to the brother and sister, but added thereto a large
portion of his own. Application was made to an earthly throne for mercy
to the repentant father; it was extended towards him, and being now a
sincere penitent, it is to be wished and hoped that he may experience
the same mercy from a still higher power.</p>

<h4><span class = "extended">THE TEMPLE OF HOPE</span>,</h4>

<p class = "center smallest"><span class = "extended">A
VISION</span>.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Reading</span> one summer’s
eve in a grove, by which ran a most beautiful translucent rivulet<ins
class = "correction" title = "text has .">,&nbsp;</ins>I was, by its
murmurs, mingled with the sighs of Zephyr, lulled into an agreeable
slumber. Somnus had no sooner laid me on his couch of poppies, than I
thought myself transported to a dreary waste, where Nature sits on her
heath-blossom’d throne, dispensing the seeds of furze, broom, brambles,
and thistles around her.</p>

<p>The sight of this barren scene would have awakened me with dismay,
had not my sight been immediately charmed, and my mind astonished with
the rising of a most superb Temple. Multitudes were repairing thither.
Misery sat on their wan cheek<span class = "locked">---</span>but I was
pleased to see, at the same time, expectation glisten in their eye.
Around
<span class = "pagenum">246b</span>
the Temple spontaneously rose, in their most perfect, fragrant, and
variegated bloom, the most beautiful parterres. Amidst the flowering
shrubs and ever-greens, were playing charming infants of both sexes,
whose talk was as melodious as the vesper of the nightingale, and as gay
as the matin of the lark. Their countenances were as blithe and as
beauteous as Flora, blushing with the kiss of Spring. I&nbsp;was
informed, that they were the children of Arts, Sciences, Peace, Plenty,
and Pleasure. Rills murmured through the walks. Fountains scattered over
the beds of perennial blossoms, their pearls of liquid crystal, and
Zephyrs, with Æolian harps, caused every leaf to dance to their
delightful harmony.</p>

<p>The style of the Temple itself united every order of architecture to
denote that it was free to the access and devotion of every country. The
Gothic, Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite were there
displayed. The walls were supported by a foundation, that,
I&nbsp;learned, was dug from the sand-pit of Expectation and the quarry
of Enterprise. The walls themselves were formed of one entire crystal,
taken from the mountain of promise. I&nbsp;presume the goddess chose
them to be formed of this material, to denote that her various devotees
might here be delighted with the most charming prospects which the magic
of fancy could create for their allurement and entertainment. It had no
roof, that nothing might impede their incessant view of the etherial
throne of Providence. Instead of pillars, the portico was supported with
anchors, which had been formerly the salvation of thousands sailing in
the bark of human misery, from being shipwrecked against the rocks of
despair. In varied festoons, hung around every apartment, cables in the
style of the most exquisite and elegant fancy. They were likewise,
wreathed with flowers of various sorts, which appeared to be always
changing, but never losing their bloom.</p>

<p>The innumerable persons of all ages, ranks, and descriptions, which
were going to this Fane, having gained admittance, the Temple rose most
majestically to the regions of bliss. Every votary knelt around the
shrine, and sung hallelujahs whilst it ascended.</p>

<p>I followed it with admiration, satisfaction, and astonishment, until
it disappeared; and the chorusses of the happy mortals, thus
transported, left my listening sense to taste in silence that ecstasy in
which so delightful a scene of human enjoyment had enwrapped my
sensibility.</p>

<p>I awoke, and was sorry to find the happiness of so many of my fellow
creatures, was only the delusive prospect of a vision.</p>

<h4><span class = "super">ON WEALTH</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Among</span> the many
advantages of wealth, that of being able to relieve the necessaries and
indigencies of others is of the greatest value, and most to be prized.
In what class of men shall we place the hard-hearted, ungenerous rich
man? Upon examination of human nature, avarice is no part of it; and so
we shall be forced to list the covetous man among the monsters of this
world.</p>

<p>Let the rich man indulge his appetites, and pursue his expences and
superfluities, if he will; and let him enable his family to indulge
themselves in the same way, if they are so inclined. But surely, then,
he ought to make as many other people easy and comfortable as he
can.</p>

<p>I am not, it is certain, obliged to pinch myself to remove other
peoples pinchings; but if a ring on my little finger has charms enough
in and about it to keep half a hundred families from starving, can I
hesitate a single moment, whether or no I shall part with this useless
bauble for that end? If a hundred or five hundred pounds will not make
me retrench in any thing, nor interfere with the figure and
circumstances of life that are proper for my family now, or when I am
dead and gone, what can I do better than give it to some other person or
family, who are obliged to live entirely below those circumstances they
are born or bred to? How can I better employ it, than in raising the
spirits, and rejoicing the heart of some melancholy, depressed poor man?
I&nbsp;am mistaken, if the application of a few hundred pounds this way,
would not give a truer sensation of joy and pleasure than fifty other
things, which are often purchased at a very dear rate.</p>

<p>Be persuaded, then, ye rich and powerful, ye honourable and great, to
do honourable things with the superfluity of your wealth.</p>

<p>Search after ingenious persons, root them out of obscurity, and
obscurity out of them, and call the long-banished muses back to their
antient habitation.</p>

<h4><span class = "extended">TRUE MEEKNESS</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword extended">Meekness</span>,
like most other virtues, has certain limits, which it no sooner exceeds
than it becomes criminal. She who hears innocence maligned without
vindicating it<span class = "locked">---</span>falsehood asserted
without contradicting it,&mdash;or religion profaned without resenting
it, is not gentle, but wicked.</p>

<p>Meekness is imperfect, if it be not both active and passive; if it
will not enable us to subdue our own passions and resentments, as well
as qualify us to bear patiently the passions and resentments of others.
If it were only for mere human reasons, it would turn to a profitable
account to be patient; nothing defeats the malice of an enemy like the
spirit of forbearance; the return of rage for rage cannot be so
effectually provoking.</p>

<p>True gentleness, like an impenetrable armour, repels the most pointed
shafts of malice: they cannot pierce through this invulnerable shield,
but either fall hurtless
<span class = "pagenum">247b</span>
to the ground, or return to wound the hand that shot them.</p>

<p>A meek spirit will not look out of itself for happiness, because it
finds a constant banquet at home; yet, by a sort of divine alchemy, it
will convert all external events to its own profit; and be able to
deduce some good, even from the most unpromising; it will extract
comfort and satisfaction, from the most barren circumstances; “it will
suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.”</p>

<p>Meekness may be called the pioneer of all the other virtues, which
levels every obstruction, and smooths every difficulty that might impede
their entrance, or retard their progress. Honours and dignities are
transient;<span class = "locked">---</span>beauty and riches frail and
fugacious;<span class = "locked">---</span>but this amiable virtue, is
permanent. And surely the truly wise would wish to have some one
possession, which they might call their own in the severest exigencies.
This can only be accomplished by acquiring and maintaining that calm and
absolute self-possession, which, as the world had no hand in giving, so
it cannot, by the most malicious exertion of its power, take away.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> man there appears
to be a natural affection for his fellow creatures, this as a general
remark is evident, when the whole bulk of mankind is considered; but if
we descend to particulars and examine how his affection exists, with
regard to individuals, how often do we find him defective. Some under
the smiling aspect of friendship conceal the envenomed sting of hatred,
while others openly declare their enmity. But philanthropy extends its
kindness to all whether friend or foe. It encircles in the arms of love,
alike the rich and poor&mdash;the bondman and the free. Anger, revenge,
and all the rougher passions which divest the mind of its serenity, and
immerse it in gloom and despondence, as if driven by supernatural power,
fly at its approach. It delights to assist the distressed and infuse
hope and comfort into the heart almost broken by misfortune. The soul
that is warmed by the genial sparks of philanthropy and benevolence,
looks with pleasure on his companions, feels himself interested in all
their transactions, and participates in their prosperity. The persecuted
are ever sure to find in him a protector, and the wretched a friend. He
exposes himself to the breath of contagion, that he may bring assistance
to those who are sinking under the accumulated load of poverty and
disease. He explores the gloomy dungeon and softens the bonds of the
captive: his whole life presents a series of benevolent and worthy
actions. Such is the philanthropist; justly admired by the world at
large, and sincerely beloved by the small circle of his friends.</p>

<p>And such was Howard---the benevolent, the philanthropic
Howard&mdash;more worthy of our admiration and more deserving of our
envy, while imbibing the deadly vapours of the lazaretto, or exposing
his constitution to the chill damps of the subterranean dungeon, than
pompous royalty clothed with the ensigns of power and encircled with all
the splendors of a court.</p>

<h4><span class = "super">ON AMBITION</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> best of all good
things, says M. Retz, is repose. All the pleasures which nature can
bestow, become insipid to him who is agitated by ambition, who is
tormented by vanity, or torn by envy. You shall see a man on whom
fortune has been prodigal of her choicest favours, to whom nature has
given a sound and vigorous body; who is beloved by his wife and his
children, whom he cherishes; whose presence spreads pleasure and joy in
his family, where he is only an apparition; who, if he lived on his own
domains, would enjoy the pleasure of doing good to a set of vassals, but
he there makes his appearance only three or four times in a year; and is
then scarcely seen till he is gone again. This man does not feel the
value of health; he does not enjoy his fortune. His life which might
flow on in that kind of animated leisure, which results from the
exercise of acts of beneficence, is consumed in agitation and in fear.
Independent by his riches, he devotes himself to servitude, and is
tormented by chagrin. His sleep, which ought to be pleasing, is troubled
by envy and disquietude. He writes, he cringes, he solicits, he tears
himself from pleasures, and gives himself up to occupations that are not
suited to his taste; he in a measure refuses to live during forty years
of his life, in order that he may obtain employment, dignities, marks of
distinction, which, when he obtains them, he cannot enjoy.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“I will</span> not pretend
to say that this class of men qualify themselves for ghost-seers by the
mortifications you have been mentioning; it is however certain, that
they are in a fair way of becoming fanatics and madmen. At the same
time, I&nbsp;think it very imprudent to sacrifice every earthly
pleasure, to neglect the duties we owe to human society, on account of
the possibility of a matter, the reality of which is founded on no
arguments whatever. It is no absolute impossibility that I should one
time be made a Mandarin of China, yet the bare possibility of it will
certainly not induce me to trouble my head with the study of the Chinese
state-politics in order to qualify myself for that dignity. Moreover, it
is not only possible, nay, it is probable that the moon is inhabited by
rational beings, I&nbsp;shall nevertheless certainly not be anxious to
give any offence to the man in the moon by my actions. But to be
serious, my friend, the point of your question is not, whether it be
possible spirits should have an influence on us and external objects,
but whether we really do possess a certain and decisive criterion
whereby we can ascertain the reality of that influence; and I think I
have sufficiently proved that we possess none. Nay I even maintain, that
if something should not only be possible, but also really exist, yet its
existence is no concern of mine, while I cannot ascertain its existence
by a sufficient ground, while it does not manifest its existence to my
knowledge by certain and indubitable criterions.”</p>

<p>“But your objection,” I resumed after a short silence, “may be
pursued still further. You maintain that I could not prove the internal
impossibility of the influence of spirits on human beings, and thus far
you are right; but I have an equal right to maintain that you also
cannot prove their real possibility; for in that case it would be
requisite to know not only what a spirit is according to our idea, but
also what it is in itself; and that only the Author of spirits can know.
We know our own soul only by its effects, and no mortal can explain the
essential nature of this first cause of all our ideas and actions. For
that very reason it ever will be concealed from us whether it is related
at all to spirits here below, and what the nature of that relation is?
Here, my friend, are the limits of human reason, beyond which we cannot
proceed without falling in with the empty space of sophistical phantoms.
While you shall remain within the lawful boundaries, you never will have
reason to complain of the insufficiency of human reason, as you have
done just now. It is criminal arrogance to overleap the sacred limits,
to which Providence has confined it; for the eternal wisdom of God is
equally entitled to our regard by what it has denied, as by what it has
granted us. Descend, therefore, my friend, descend from the empty space
to which the Irishman had seduced you, to the firm
<span class = "pagenum">250b</span>
ground of experience and common sense! Happy is he who looks upon this
ground as a post allotted to him, which we can never transgress without
being punished, and which implies every thing that can afford us
satisfaction while we keep firm to what is useful.”</p>

<p>About six weeks after this conversation, I happened one night to sup
with the Marquis in the company of his son and Alumbrado. Our discourse
on the new government was growing very warm, when the clock in the room
struck ten. Alumbrado suddenly grew deadly wan, and seemed to be struck
dumb; his eyes stared at one spot, and he resembled a lifeless statue.
We looked at each other with astonishment; the old Marquis was the first
who called to him, but received no answer, and started up seized with
terror. The Duke and myself followed his example; our endeavours to
restore Alumbrado to recollection were, however, fruitless; he remained
in profound stupefaction. Not knowing what had happened to him, we were
going to send for a physician, when he rose from his chair like a person
to whom nothing uncommon has happened, and told us with the greatest
unconcern, “This very moment a strange accident has happened 300 miles
from hence. At *li*, at the Sun Tavern, the picture of the new king
which was hung up in the dining room, give occasion to a discourse
concerning him. One of the guests said a great deal to his praise,
manifesting, at the same time, a&nbsp;strong apprehension that the King
of <span class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n</span> might
not submit so quietly to the loss of the crown of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l</span>, and perhaps, reclaim it
by force of arms. Another guest declared this to be a vain idea,
maintaining that the new King was as firmly fixed on his throne as his
picture opposite him on the wall: but no sooner had he pronounced these
words, when the picture suddenly fell to the ground with a tremendous
noise.”</p>

<p>Here Alumbrado stopped. While we were standing around him in dumb
astonishment, he eyed us with the firm look of a person who has related
an incident of which he has been an eye witness. Astonishment and horror
seized me, and I did not know what to say. The Duke recovered first from
his surprise, asking him by what means he had got that intelligence.
“I&nbsp;must beg you,” Alumbrado replied in a low accent, “to suppress a
question to which I can give no satisfactory answer. However,” he added
with emphasis, “you may rely on the truth of my intelligence.”</p>

<p>He had not deceived us. On the sixth day after this extraordinary
incident, letters from *li* arrived confirming the same event, and nine
days after, it was reported in the foreign newspapers. It really
happened on the same evening, and the same night when Alumbrado had
informed us of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Being unexpectedly honoured by the new King with a commission that
obliged me to leave the kingdom of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;l</span>, soon after this extraordinary incident
had happened, I&nbsp;was not at leisure to investigate the source of
Alumbrado’s prophecy; nor could I learn the Duke’s opinion of it; my
deluded friend beginning to grow very close and reserved in my presence.
It grieved me to be
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page251" id = "page251">251</a></span>
obliged to leave him in Alumbrado’s power, under such critical
circumstances, I&nbsp;could however, not delay my departure. The Duke
tore himself from my embraces with weeping eyes, and promised to write
frequently to&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>A week after my arrival at the place of my destination, I received a
letter from my friend, which I am going to transcribe faithfully.</p>

<p>“I have had to-day a most important conversation with Alumbrado. The
principal subject of it was the old concealed King of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l</span>, for whose restoration I
had interested myself. ‘Can you seriously believe<span class =
"locked">---</span>’ Alumbrado said, ‘that the person with whom you have
conversed at the Hermitage, has really been the old King of <span class
= "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l</span>? It seems you did not
even suspect that the introduction of the old man was a juggling farce,
which was acted with a view similar to those of the other delusions of
the Irishman? Although we should suppose that the King had not been
killed in the field of battle, and that he himself had been the
identical person who was confined at the castle of St. Lukar, which
however, has not been proved, yet the whole affair would still bear a
very suspicious aspect. Not to mention the great improbability of his
escape from a well-guarded Castle, where he was kept in close
confinement, and of his having attained an age of 108 years
notwithstanding the hardships he suffered in the field of battle, and in
his prison. I&nbsp;only beg you to consider who it was that introduced
him to you as King of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l</span>? Was not the Irishman
that person? At the same time, give me leave to recal to your
recollection, that Count Clairval has confessed that the pretended King
acted in concert with that impostor, and then tell me sincerely, what
ground you have to believe such an improbability on the testimony of two
cheats? Perhaps you will appeal to his great resemblance to the late
King? But have not three persons before him pleaded similar marks as
proofs of the identity of their person, and nevertheless been unmasked
as impostors? My good Duke, on mature consideration it seems that the
Irishman relied very much on your youth and the absence of your tutor,
when he imposed upon you by that juggling trick<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ”">.’&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“Ah! what ideas do you recall to my memory! I exclaimed, that letter
from the Queen and the answer of the Irishman.”</p>

<p><ins class = "correction"
title = "text has single for double quote">“Very</ins> right! Alumbrado interrupted me, these letters
sufficiently prove that you was considered as a young man who promised
to be a fit instrument for executing their design. And it is no longer a
secret what that design was, and in whose head it has been hatched out.
The proud Duchess of <span class = "locked">B&mdash;&mdash;za</span> had
a longing for the crown of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l</span>, and it was she who
persuaded the Duke to form a plan of seizing it. Your assistance, my
dear Duke, was wanted for attaining that aim, but the conspirators
foresaw at the same time, that you would refuse it, your antipathy
against your illustrious relation being no secret to them. For that
reason they pretended that the Duke of <span class =
"locked">B&mdash;&mdash;a</span> had no other view but to replace the
old King on the throne of his ancestors. It was necessary you
<span class = "pagenum">251b</span>
should be made to believe that he was still alive and in safety; for
that purpose the hermit was brought on the stage, and acted his part
with no common skill.”</p>

<p>“Damned complot!” I exclaimed, with rising indignation. “Compose
yourself my Lord,” Alumbrado resumed, “your anger will now avail you
very little. Take care not to manifest your indignation too loudly, lest
the new King might forget that you are his relation, and have assisted
him to ascend the throne. You can do nothing else at present, but to
submit humbly to his authority; and I advise you at the same time not to
neglect paying due regard to the Queen, for she rules the King and the
empire. Do not expect that the present King will yield the sceptre he
has usurped to any man living. If you <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘do’nt’">don’t</ins> believe me, you may inquire of him after
the old King, and he will tell you, that he has resigned the government
to him, because he feels himself unequal to the arduous task of ruling a
large kingdom, on account of his advanced age, or perhaps that he is
dead.”</p>

<p>“My dear Marquis, what do you think of this? I fear Alumbrado is not
mistaken, and I am in a state of mind that would render it imprudent for
me to appear at court; but as soon as the tempest that ruffles my mind
shall be subdued, I&nbsp;will pay a visit to the new King in order to
come to the bottom of the truth.</p>

<p>“P.S. You will be so kind to continue to direct your letters to
Li*bon, for neither I nor my father <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘shall shall’">shall</ins> leave the town this summer.”</p>

<p>Before I could return an answer to this letter, I received a second,
the contents of which were as follow:</p>

<p>“Will you believe, my friend, that I desired three times to have an
audience, before my royal cousin condescended to admit me to his
presence? This utter want of regard and gratitude, re-kindled my
indignation, in such a manner, that I entered the royal apartment in a
way that was not very consonant with the court etiquette. The King,
however, received me very courteously, pretending to be extremely sorry
that the accumulated affairs of state had not allowed him to receive my
visit sooner, declaring at the same time that he was very glad to see
me. ‘I&nbsp;am come, I&nbsp;replied, in order to tell you that I am
surprised that the old King has not yet made his appearance, and
released you from the heavy burden of state business<ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ”">.’&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“Don’t you know that he is dead?”</p>

<p>‘The emotions that I felt at these words are beyond all description;
and my astonishment, the paleness that overspread my face, and my
silence must have betrayed them to the King.’</p>

<p>“At what are you astonished thus? not at the death of an old man of a
hundred and eight years?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied after a pause, “but I am surprised that he died at so
seasonable a period.”</p>

<p>“Will you explain yourself more distinctly?”</p>

<p>“I think it is a very strange accident that the royal hermit should
have entered the kingdom of heaven, and left your Majesty the terrestial
crown, just when he was to show himself to the people as their lawful
King.”</p>

<h4><i>The Power of Music; or, the History of Belario and
Lucetta.</i></h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Belario</span> was a youth
who had been bred up under his father’s eye, according to the most rigid
morals. Old Syphax had, in the early part of his life, been a great dupe
to the fair sex; he had fancied himself a <i>beau <ins class =
"correction" title = "printed without cedilla">garcon</ins></i>, and
imagined he had a right to captivate every female he thought proper to
address. In this opinion he was greatly mistaken, and meeting with a
variety of coquettes and jilts, he found himself often deceived by his
own artifice, and after having squandered considerable sums upon them,
discovered he was only laughed at for his vanity and folly. He, however,
pursued the career of a general lover for upwards of a dozen years; in
the course of which time he had much injured his fortune, in dangling
after beauties who despised him, and substituting in their place
professed harlots. At length he closed the circle of his amours in
marrying, out of mere spight, his own cook-maid, by whom he had
Belario.&mdash;His consort, though she had approved herself an excellent
cook, turned out a dreadful wife. She no sooner attained the summit of
her ambition, which she had long aimed at, and which she obtained by the
most servile flattery, and the greatest humility imaginable, than she
threw off the independant, and soon convinced Syphax, she knew the
difference between a servile state and that of a mistress. In a word,
she was the modern Zantippe, and probably Socrates never led half so
wretched a life, as did poor Syphax, after the connubial knot was tied.
He now took an aversion to the whole sex, swore eternal enmity to them,
and made a solemn vow, after separating from his wife, soon after the
expiration of the <ins class = "correction" title = "two words">honey
moon</ins>, never to associate or speak to a woman in the course of his
future life. Upon the birth of his son he immediately sent for him, and
would never let him know who was his mother.</p>

<p>As Belario advanced towards maturity, he had him educated under his
own roof, having resolved that he should not be trained at a public
school, lest, by associating with the world, he might imbibe their
notions in favour of the female sex. He never suffered him to read any
books that had the least allusion to the tender passion, and constantly
represented women, whenever they were mentioned, as monsters in human
forms, and more to be dreaded than wolves and tigers. In this opinion
whenever Belario beheld a female at a distance, he fled from her with
the greatest swiftness, fearful that even the air might be contaminated
with her breath. Yet he thought that there was something enchanting in
woman, which he could not account for; but if he hinted such a thought
to his father, Syphax depicted them as Syrens, who allured unwary
travellers to approach them for their destruction.</p>

<p>Tutored with these extraordinary notions, Belario had attained his
eighteenth year, when Syphax paid the great debt of nature, and left his
son in possession of an easy fortune. He began now to relax from the
<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘veverity’">severity</ins>
of those studies, to which he had been confined. He read
<span class = "pagenum">252b</span>
novels, Ovid’s <ins class = "correction"
title = "capitalized as shown">Art of love</ins>, and many other books, that soon made him
suspect his father’s doctrine had been fallacious. Belario had not,
however, the fortitude to dare approach a female so nearly, as to enjoy
the contemplation of her charms, or the enchanting raptures of her
conversation; when one day walking in a pensive mood, in a grove
adjacent to his abode, his ears were assailed with such harmoneous
accents as involuntarily attracted not only his attention, but, by a
secret impulse, led him to the spot where the seeming celestial notes
proved to issue.</p>

<p>He had scarce reached the hawthorn of melody, before he perceived the
lovely Lucetta singing, accompanied by her guittar. Now, in despight of
all his father’s tenets so carefully inculcated, he found the impulse of
nature, and the power of music, operate far beyond all the sophistry of
Syphax’s reasoning against the lovely sex.</p>

<p>He intuitively approached the beauteous maid, and instantly became a
captive to her charms<span class = "locked">---</span>a votary to love
and harmony.</p>

<p>Lucetta at first received him with some reserve; but after a fervent
declaration of his passion, which soon became sympathetic, she listened
to his addresses; when he revealed to her how much he had been imposed
upon by Syphax, who represented the most amiable part of the creation as
monsters, more dangerous than serpents and crocodiles, and that in this
opinion he had shunned them to this very hour; but that he now flattered
himself he should make ample amends in paying his devotions to such an
angelic being as the divine Lucetta.</p>

<p>This young lady was the only daughter of a gentleman of property in
an adjacent village, whom Belario, with the approbation of Lucetta,
waited upon to obtain his consent for their nuptials. Her father
received the young man with politeness and hospitality, and told him he
should have no objection to the match, if he could obtain his daughter’s
consent. Happy in such a reply, he flew to his adored Lucetta, and
acquainted her with the glad tidings, which she received with as much
transport as he communicated them.</p>

<p>To be brief, in a few days their nuptials were solemnized, and they
have now enjoyed the most permanent felicity the connubial state can
confer, for upwards of two years, in which time the lovely Lucetta has
given to the world two pledges of their mutual fondness, in a delightful
boy, and a still more beautiful girl. Here we shall leave them, to enjoy
that unsullied happiness which ever attends the purest virtue, and the
sincerest love.</p>

conceal Harland’s visit, but my father heard of it from his servant. He
accused me of having concerted it, I&nbsp;declared my innocence. He
vowed if I saw Harland my husband should be acquainted with it. How
cruel such harshness. Mr. Mordaunt soon left the castle, he brought me
to London; he loved dissipation, and I entered into it, I&nbsp;thought
it would banish painful reflections. At the expiration of a year Heaven
blest me with a lovely infant. My health was now so delicate, the
physicians ordered me to Bristol. Mordaunt accompanied me thither, not
indeed out of tenderness, but ostentation; he wished the world to think
him perfect, and yet counterfeited a love for me, which in reality
existed not, as his heart was too depraved to be long susceptible of a
virtuous passion. My father accompanied us. We had a house one mile from
Bristol. Each morning I went to the rooms, the remainder of the day was
spent in weeping, and praying over my child, in lulling her to sleep,
and hushing her feeble cries.</p>

<p>I had just entered the room one morning, and was conversing with a
young lady, when turning round, I&nbsp;was startled by the figure of
Harland. Struck by his appearance, various emotions rushed upon me,
I&nbsp;could scarcely stand, trembling I leaned upon my
companion&mdash;the alteration of his looks too visibly manifested the
disorder of his mind; despair tinged every feature, and the lustre of
his eyes was totally extinguished. I&nbsp;hurried from the room<span

I&nbsp;would have discontinued going to the rooms, only I feared
exciting the prying eyes of suspicion. I&nbsp;again went, beheld him,
and returned more unhappy. In the afternoon, walking alone in the
garden, I&nbsp;saw a bit of paper thrown over the hedge, I&nbsp;snatched
it up, and perceiving Harland’s writing<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has .">,&nbsp;</ins>I started, I&nbsp;hesitated whether to open
it<span class = "locked">---</span>imagination pictured his
sufferings<span class = "locked">---</span>I broke the seal, and perused
the following lines:</p>

<p>“Julia, the miserable Harland is on the point of eternally quitting
his native kingdom, he flies to remote regions, far distant from an
object who has banished peace&mdash;will she yet be cruel, or will her
nature, once gently kind, comply with the last request of one, whose
last sigh will be for her. Oh Julia! to leave this kingdom without
bidding you adieu, is more than I can support<span class =
"locked">---</span>I sicken at the idea. Refuse me not, I&nbsp;conjure
you, one parting interview, to sooth the solitary hours of my life,

you must, leave a note where you received this, and at any hour or place

lamented object of my soul.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">253b</span>
<p>I could not refuse his last request---I was not proof against such
entreaties, I&nbsp;might be censured, but I could not conquer the tender
feelings which compelled me to comply. After supper, I&nbsp;stole to a
little shady bower, situated in a shrubbery, and seldom frequented by
any but myself. Here Harland waited for me<span class =

inarticulate, he took my hand and prest it to his palpitating heart,

my fate. At that instant Mr. Mordaunt and my father rushed into the

former flew at Harland from whose arms I had sunk, full of the most
direful apprehensions. He attempted to remonstrate, but in vain, the
sword was at his breast, the instructive impulse of self-preservation
prompted his defence, it was too dreadful to behold. I&nbsp;fainted, and
in a happy insensibility was conveyed to my chamber. Returning life made

Sir George and Mr. Mordaunt had both left the house with solemn
asseverations of never again beholding me. Harland, dear ill-fated
Harland, had paid the last sad debt of nature. My husband had stood his
trial, but possessed of interest and wealth, he was soon acquitted; my
child he had taken with him, and left orders for me to quit the house on
my recovery; also a paper wherein I was informed of the settlement made
on me, and the person on whom I was to draw for it. Miss Rivers, my
faithful friend, neglected me not in the hour of severe calamity; she
had me conveyed to a family in Wales, who had just retired there, and
had no objection to receive me as a boarder. Heartbroken, I&nbsp;forsook
a world where my dearest hopes were blasted, yet I left it with no
impious repinings against my destiny. I&nbsp;confessed myself properly
punished, humbled to the dust&mdash;I felt the impropriety of having
ever placed myself in a suspicious situation; but I was thoroughly
penitent for having (though I trusted in a slight degree) deviated from
the path of rectitude&mdash;Heaven, I&nbsp;fancied, accepted my
contrition, by placing me in a family of love, such as I shall now
describe.</p>

<p>Captain Harley, after a life of activity in the service of his
country, retired to a sweet retreat in South Wales, to enjoy the closing
evening of a busy day; his family consisted of a wife, the faithful
companion of all his sorrows, and one daughter, who being the only
survivor of a numerous offspring, was doubly endeared to them. She was
the staff of their age, the doating of their hopes, and they bore her
continually on their hearts, to that heaven which they knew would alone
protect her from those calamitous strokes they had so often experienced
in the course of their lives.</p>

<p>The retreat they had chosen, was by its seclusion, calculated for the
narrowness of their income, and by its beauty for the promotion of their
pleasure.</p>

<p>He rented but as much land as would supply his household wants, this
he delighted in cultivating himself, assisted by an old trusty servant
who had been a soldier in his regiment. Conrade was the veteran son of
calamity, and his misfortunes strengthened the claim his services had
given him upon the affections of his master. During a late contest,
a&nbsp;brave and only son had fallen by his side in the field of battle;
scarcely could he survive the blow, but consolation effected what
fortitude had no power to do. Captain Harley was not only a good soldier
but a good christian, and by pointing out the path to heaven, gave poor
Conrade full assurance, by faithfully discharging the humble duties of
his station, he should obtain a passport to rejoin his brave and beloved
son.</p>

<p>Louisa at the period of their retirement was fifteen; her mind and
form were opening to perfection, and both promised to contain the
fairest loveliness of ingenious innocence, and graceful symmetry.</p>

<p>The lilly and the rose gave their most beautiful tints to
<span class = "pagenum">254b</span>
her complection; her fine black eyes beamed with the sensibility of her
soul, never did she hear the tale of sorrow without emotion.</p>

<p>Harley had little to give, of that little he gave
abundantly&mdash;not the largeness of the gift but real inclination of
the donor, he knew was regarded by the power above. Like the benevolent
pastor of Auburn village, to him repaired the needy and the wanderer,
and found a ready welcome&mdash;often too, the weather beaten soldier in
journeying to his native home, to lay his bones among those of his
forefathers, turned in hither, and cheared by hospitable fare,</p>

<div class = "verse smaller w28">
<p>“Shoulder’d his crutch, &amp; shew’d how fields were won.”</p>
</div>

<p>Harley knew what it was to have the unsheltered head exposed to the
chill blast and sharp bitings of the wintry frost.</p>

<p>Such was this little family of love, who retired amidst Welch
mountains, enjoyed that content and happiness which the votaries of
fashion, misled by dissipation, can never experience.</p>

<p>Louisa was my constant companion&mdash;like a ministering seraph she
hushed the turbulence of anguish, and whispered peace to my perturbed
soul.</p>

<h4>PLEASURES OF OLD AGE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Though</span>, in old age,
the circle of pleasure is contracted, yet within its limits many of
those enjoyments remain which are most grateful to human nature.</p>

<p>Temperate mirth is not extinguished by advanced years; the mild
pleasures of domestic life still cheer the heart. The entertainments of
conversation and social intercourse continue unimpaired. The desire of
knowledge is not abated by the frailty of the body, and the leisure of
old age affords many opportunities for gratifying that desire. The
sphere of observation and reflection is so much enlarged by long
acquaintance with the world, as to supply, within itself, a&nbsp;wide
range of improving thought. Whilst the aged are engaged in such
employments as best suit the infirmities of their nature, they are
surrounded, perhaps with families, who treat them with attention and
respect; they are honoured by their friends; their characters are
established, and are placed beyond the reach of clamour and the strife
of tongues; and free from distracting cares can calmly attend to their
eternal interests.</p>

<p>No age is doomed to total infelicity provided that we attempt not to
do violence to nature, by seeking to extort from one age the pleasures
of another, and to gather in the winter of life those flowers which were
destined to blossom only in its summer or its spring.</p>


<p class = "twin w33">&nbsp;</p>

<h4><span class = "giant">WIT</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Wit</span> is the most
dangerous talent we can possess. It must be guarded with great
discretion and good nature, otherwise it will create many enemies.</p>

<p>Wit is perfectly consistent with softness and delicacy; yet they are
seldom found united. Wit is so flattering to vanity, that they who
possess it become intoxicated, and lose all self-command.</p>

<p>Though it is the most captivating, yet it is the most dreaded of all
talents: the most dangerous to those who have it, and the most feared by
those who have it not. He who is grown rich without it, in safe and
sober dulness, shuns it as a disease, and looks upon poverty as its
invaluable concomitant.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">257b</span>
<p>The moralist declaims against it as the source of irregularity; and
the frugal citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy itself: for he
considers it as the parent of extravagance and beggary. The Cynic will
ask of what use is it? Of very little perhaps: no more is a flower
garden, and yet it is allowed, as an object of innocent amusement, and
delightful recreation.</p>

<p>A woman who possesses this quality has received a most dangerous
present, perhaps not less so than beauty itself; especially if it be not
sheathed in a temper peculiarly inoffensive, chastised by a most correct
judgment, and restrained by more prudence than falls to the common
lot.</p>

<p>This talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for
there is much more danger that folly should arise from the confederation
of what is our own, than of what we borrow. But wit, like learning, is
not near so common a thing as is imagined. For flippancy, pertness, and
impudence are often mistaken for this brilliant quality; and people
often imagine they are witty, only because they are indiscreet, and this
makes the name of wit so cheap, while its real existence is so rare.</p>

<p>But those who happily possess this talent, cannot be too abstinent in
the use of it. It often makes admirers, but never makes friends; and
she, who does not desire friends, has a sordid and insensible soul; but
she, who is ambitious of making every man her admirer, has an invincible
vanity and a cold heart.</p>


<p class = "twin w33">&nbsp;</p>

<h4><span class = "super">GRATITUDE</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Gratitude</span> is a
pleasing emotion. The sense of being distinguished by the kindness of
another, gladdens the heart, warms it with reciprocal affection, and
gives to any profession, which is agreeable in itself, a&nbsp;double
relish, from its being the gift of a friend. Favours, though conferred
by men, may become burdensome; but nothing of this kind can affect the
intercourse of gratitude with heaven. Its favors are wholly
disinterested. The Almighty aims at no end but the happiness of those
whom he blesses, and who desires to return from them but a devout and
thankful heart.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“It</span> was an
accident.”</p>

<p>“And a very fortunate one for your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“What do you call fortunate? My family had a lawful claim to the
crown of P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l, and I have an additional right
to the possession of it because I have torn it from the head of the
usurper at the risk of my life. I&nbsp;would, however, have resigned it
cheerfully to my grand uncle if his death had not destroyed that plan.
You are mistaken if you think the lot of a King to be so enviable. The
burden of government lies heavy on my shoulders.”</p>

<p>“O! there are means of alleviating that load.”</p>

<p>“Of which I shall make as little use as possible, for it will be the
chief object of my cares, and will afford me the greatest pleasure to
render my people happy.”</p>

<p>“Who could doubt it? Yet I think one ought to make the death of the
deceased King publicly known.”</p>

<p>“If we could but first convince the people that he has been alive
lately. The profound incognito behind which he concealed himself, throws
an insurmountable bar in our way. No one would believe&nbsp;us.”</p>

<p>“Upon my honour, I almost disbelieve it myself any longer.”</p>

<p>“You are right; one needs not to believe what one is convinced of,
for you have seen him with your own eyes. If fate had suffered him to
show himself in public, every one would have acknowledged him to have
been the person that he really was, the old lawful King of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l</span>. Having, however, lived
and died in obscurity, the whole matter may remain a secret, and that so
much the more because the discovery would be intirely useless. It is
therefore my royal pleasure that no mention whatever be made of it.
Farewell!” he added after a short pause, “you will always find me your
affectionate King.”</p>

<p>‘Thus ended my audience. Do not desire me, my friend, to disclose to
you the ideas and sensations which it produced within me. I&nbsp;shall
endeavour to obliterate even the recollection of that scene.</p>

<p>‘Alumbrado is very much displeased with the manner in which I have
spoken to the King. “Do you imagine,” said he, “that his offended pride
ever will forgive you the torments of that self-denial which the
patience he has opposed to your galling language has cost him? The
sacrifice which he has made to his policy by that painful forbearance,
will certainly cost you dear. Henceforward, you must renounce every hope
of being promoted; for he will be careful to keep in submission, and at
a proper distance, a&nbsp;man of spirit, as you must have appeared to
him. This is perhaps the least misfortune that threatens you; your
warmth, your ill-timed frankness, may produce consequences of a more
serious nature. Alas! why have you not been on your guard?
<span class = "pagenum">258b</span>
Have I not advised you to appear with humility in his presence?”</p>

<p>‘Alumbrado had certainly the most friendly view in reprimanding me
thus: he did not know that every word of his wounded my heart like a
two-edged dagger.</p>

<p>‘I have been interrupted by the visit of a Prelate of very high rank.
He came to inform my father and myself that the Vice Queen of <span
class = "locked">P&mdash;t&mdash;l</span> had been imprisoned by the
order of the King, because she has had the imprudence to declare that
the new King had usurped the throne in a fraudulent manner, and that it
was the duty of every inhabitant of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;t&mdash;l</span> to acknowledge only the King of
Sp&mdash;n as his lawful sovereign, because the voluntary oath of
allegiance the <span class = "locked">P&mdash;t&mdash;se</span> had
sworn to the latter, could not be made void by that which the Duke of
B-&nbsp;-&nbsp;-&nbsp;a had obtained by artifice and force.
“I&nbsp;cannot conceive,” the Prelate added, “what reasonable objection
can be alledged against this declaration; but nevertheless, no one dares
to affirm it, for fear of sharing the fate of the Vice-Queen.”</p>

<p>‘The Vice-Queen and the Prelate, appear to me to be in the right.
However, what can be done? Farewell, my friend, and let it not be long
before you favour me with an answer.</p>

<p>‘P.S. This very moment I received an answer to a letter I had wrote
to a friend near the place where the hermit lived. He informs me that
the old man expired four months since, worn out with age.’</p>

<p>I suspected already from the first letter, but more so from the
second, that the Duke was in danger of taking a course from which he
could not return too soon. I&nbsp;imagined I had discovered the design
which Alumbrado had formed upon him and shuddered at the idea that he
might carry his point. Yet my suspicion against Alumbrado was also a
mere supposition, which gave me no right to accuse him. After mature
consideration I thought, however, it would be best to deliver the Duke,
against whom his plan appeared so be chiefly directed, from his
clutches, and thus expected to gain two advantages by one stroke: not
only to cut the sinews of Alumbrado’s undertaking asunder, but also to
guard the Duke against the snare which was laid for him.</p>

<p>With that view I wrote to the latter:</p>

<p>‘Your letters have been very important to me; I must, however, beg
you to fetch my answer yourself. Don’t refuse my request, and hasten to
the arms of your friend, whose happiness in a place on which nature
seems to have lavished all her blessings, would be complete if you were
present. Here we will discuss the political concerns which give you so
much uneasiness, for I have more than one reason for not doing it by way
of letter, and my affairs threaten to detain me here some time longer.
The journey will not only improve your health, but it will also ease
your mind, which is bent down at present by a gloomy sameness of ideas,
and very much wants amusement and diversion. I&nbsp;am convinced that
your melancholy will not pursue you to the paradise that blossoms here.
And if only your gloominess of mind shall have left you, you will view
things that now appear to you in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page259" id = "page259">259</a></span>
a frightful shape, in a more pleasing light. At the same time you may
expect that the commission the King has charged me with, will enable me
to explain to you many political objects which I dare not do in writing.
Come, my friend, you certainly will not regret your having undertaken
this journey, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp;&amp;c.’</p>

<p>My letter produced the desired effect. The Duke returned me a very
affectionate answer, and promised, to begin the journey in a fortnight.
How joyfully and impatiently did my heart pant for his arrival! but I
was disappointed. He did not come, but sent me a letter, which I am
going to communicate to the reader.</p>

<p>‘Why am I not yet arrived? Ask Heaven that question, but not me, for
I have done every thing in my power to fulfil my promise. In spite of
Alumbrado’s remonstrances, I&nbsp;went on board of the ship to convey me
to my friend. A&nbsp;favourable breeze that swelled our sails enlivened
my hopes of embracing you soon. Evening set in, and the wind and the sky
continued to be propitious. The second and the third night stole upon us
amid the same favourable auspices.</p>

<p>‘I do not know how it happened, that on the third night the
recollection of my sainted Amelia awoke within my mind with additional
vivacity. It was not, however, associated with painful, but with
bitter-sweet sensations, which frequently afford to feeling minds a more
delicious pleasure than joys unmixed. I&nbsp;proceeded insensibly from
sensations to the realms of fancy. I&nbsp;looked at the star of love,
and imagined I beheld Amelia’s sainted spirit enthroned in its silver
lustre. My soul soared above the immense space that separated us, and
anticipated the bliss of the celestial spirits. O! why has she so soon
been rendered insensible of the limits of her power, which obliged her
to return to our sublunary globe?</p>

<p>‘I felt a faintness which invited me to rest, and having bid adieu to
the starry firmament and the ocean<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has .">,&nbsp;</ins>I went to my cabin, where the solacing hand of
sleep soon closed my eyes.</p>

<p>‘I awoke an hour before the dawn of morn. Finding myself entirely
refreshed I left my couch and returned on deck in order to hail the
stars once more, before they should be dispelled by the majestic king of
day. But what a scene did my gazing eyes behold! The firmament appeared
no longer to be over us, but we seemed to ride upon it. I&nbsp;did not
know whether I was dreaming or awake, rubbing my eyes repeatedly. In
vain, the scene remained unaltered: intense darkness covered the sky,
all its stars and galaxies appeared to be on the water.</p>

<p>‘O nature! thy grateful son never will forget the enjoyment which
this undescribable spectacle has afforded him! I&nbsp;gazed a long time
in silent wonder at the illuminated surface of the ocean, before I could
examine the individual beauties of that grand scene. Whithersoever I
directed my gazing looks, I&nbsp;beheld fiery streaks. However, all
parts were not equally illuminated; some spots emitted quick flashes of
light, while others continued some minutes to sparkle. The separated
water gushed before us in luminous streams, and the furrow which the
vessel drew formed a white bright streak behind us, which
<span class = "pagenum">259b</span>
was interspersed with sky-blue spots. The multifarious and dazzling
light was skipping on the curling waves; the spume which the little
bubbles produced on the surface of the water, glittered like
silver-coloured snow. I&nbsp;could have plunged in the watery abyss in
order to sink down in that heaven.</p>

<p>‘The rising sun put a stop to that enchantment. My fellow travellers
began to stir. I&nbsp;hastened to tell them what a scene they had
missed. A&nbsp;reverend old man, who was present when I related what I
had seen, smiled. “One can see,” said he, “that this is your first
voyage; this phenomenon is nothing uncommon in all seasons, and
particularly in warmer climes; nevertheless the naturalists still differ
in their opinion of its cause, some believing that it proceeds from
small luminous insects, and others from an oily substance that separates
from rotten animal bodies.&mdash;Many pretend this phenomenon to be the
forerunner of an impending tempest, but this is false<ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ,">”.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>‘The old man may not have been mistaken, yet this time he was refuted
by experience. The little clouds which were swimming singly in the sky,
united by degrees and overdarkened the sun. A&nbsp;black tempest began
to gather in the north. The crew were just going to prepare against the
storm, when suddenly a violent gale of wind arose, and hurried the
vessel with incredible rapidity over the ruffled surface of the sea. We
lost one of our anchors, which fell from the deck with a thundering
noise. Some loud peals of thunder gave the signal for the breaking out
of the storm. The light of day disappeared, the billows of the swelling
sea were rolling one upon another with a roaring noise; the dreadful
flashes of lightening seemed to dye the surface of the ocean with blood,
and each clap of thunder threatened to shiver the mast to atoms. The
foaming of the waves, the rolling of thunder, and the howling of the
winds, seemed to announce to that part of the world the return of old
chaos.</p>

<p>‘The strong flashes of lightning made us suddenly observe that land
was near. How welcome soever such a discovery is in fair weather, yet it
was to us the most dreadful incident that could have happened, on
account of imminent danger of being wrecked. Our cables seemed not to be
able to resist long the fury of the winds and waves which availed the
vessel.</p>

<p>‘All these circumstances contributed to recall to my mind the
recollection of a similar incident which had robbed me of my Amelia. The
wounds of my heart began to bleed afresh, and the melancholy sensations
which assailed my mind, deprived me of the power that I, otherwise,
should have opposed to the terrors which surrounded me. My heart beat
violently against my breast, and nothing but my ambition could have
prevented me from joining those who groaned and lamented loudly,
wringing their hands and tearing their hair.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Certain</span> persons have
for some time past been carrying on a dispute relative to the talents of
women, and the dispute I perceive has found its way into your
miscellany. I&nbsp;believe, Sir, the question might be soon settled to
the satisfaction of all parties, if, we were first to agree in what is
meant, or should be meant by the word talents. Hitherto, if I understand
the controversy, talents have been understood to mean the power <ins
class = "correction" title = "text has ‘of’">or</ins> faculty of
publishing in prose and verse; and if we limit it to this, we may easily
decide, that women are inferior to men, because there have been probably
a thousand male authors for one female.</p>

<p>But, Sir, with submission, I would beg leave to suggest, that we
narrow human genius and ability very much, when we confine them to the
bookseller’s shop. Are there not many very able Statesmen who never
write any thing but Treasury-warrants, and receipts for their salaries?
Nay, do we not admire the vast genius of some Representatives, whose
<i>forte</i> is entirely in speaking, and who, when compelled to draw up
an address to their independent constituents, commit errors that would
disgrace a school-boy? In short, Sir, if we have no other way of judging
of a man’s talents, but by the quantity he publishes, either from the
press or from his mouth, are we not giving all the praise to mere
saying; and never reflecting that an accumulation of words, without
corresponding actions, is to all necessary purposes useless and
unprofitable?</p>

<p>This being premised, and, I hope, allowed, we need dispute no longer
about the superiority of the male sex. The talents of the fair sex, as
to all the great and important events of human life, and all the leading
transactions of kingdoms and states have so far transcended what has
been attributed to us, that were I to compile a new Universal History,
however I might avail myself of the valuable labours contained in the
old, I&nbsp;should certainly entitle it, “A&nbsp;history of the Power
and Influence of the Female Sex, from the fall of Adam to the present
time.” It is the pitiful jealousy and envy of men which has deprived the
sex of the honours due to them in history; and likewise some part of the
concealment of their influence, arises from the brevity of histories,
their authors taking a superficial view of events, and seldom troubling
themselves to investigate the secret springs of human action; whereas,
if we will only examine into the minute particulars of great events, the
secret intrigues of Courts, Kings and Ministers, or even of Republics,
we shall always find that the women have had a great share in bringing
about political changes, wars, treaties, negociations, &amp;c. although
they, for modesty probably, content themselves with acting unseen and
unobserved, and the men, proud of the success of the affair, wish to
take all the merit to themselves. Now, Sir, let me ask you a plain
<span class = "pagenum">260b</span>
question: which of the two is likely to deserve most fame, and to confer
greater renown on the party, the publishing a poem, or bringing about a
Revolution in a state or nation, perhaps with a few words? Which
requires greater abilities, to govern a kingdom, or to cajole a
bookseller? To tickle the fancy of love-sick boys and girls by a novel,
or to confound and stun half the Cabinets of Europe, by a bold stroke of
invasion, a&nbsp;massacre, and a partition? To write a ballad about a
man and woman who never existed, or to make the existence of thousands
of men and women miserable?</p>

<p>But this is not all. It is not enough to appeal to the history of
ancient and modern nations, for proofs of the superiority of women over
men. This, perhaps, is not much in their favour, for a superiority of
evil influence is not the present contest, and would not be very
honourable if it were established. No, Sir, if we wish to ascertain the
real and meritorious superiority of female talents, we need not consult
the voluminous records of history; we need only bring the question home
to ourselves. I&nbsp;shall instance but in one respect, the power of
persuasion. This I take to be the great test of genius and talents. He
who possesses this, possesses every thing; and yet we know that what a
man cannot do by whole treatises and volumes, by a well connected chain
of argument, and <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘the the’">the</ins> most convincing calculations, is generally done by a
woman with a smile, a&nbsp;glance of the eye, or a very few words. Sir,
we may talk as we please of our vast learning, of our voluminous
productions, of our many virtues for which we obtain credit in epithets
and funeral sermons. But with what painful efforts do we accomplish the
least of our good actions! and to do a great good is the business of a
long life. What is all our power compared, or, which is more dangerous,
put in competition with a <span class = "smallroman">TEAR</span> or a
<span class = "smallroman">FIT</span>?</p>

<p>I repeat it, Sir, let us bring the question home to ourselves. What
is it that constitutes the felicity of domestic life? Is it the wealth
we have acquired, the house we live in, the equipage that bespeaks our
rank, or the servants that bow at our command? No. Sir, to use an
expression of Mr. Burke, it is, “the dignified obedience and proud
submission” we owe and pay to the female sex. Our hearts confess that
they deserve it, and that we cannot help paying it, and cannot,
therefore, help acknowledging their superiority. When we refuse to pay
it, when our minds are in a state of rebellion against those lawful
sovereigns, where is it that we dare to breathe sentiments of a
seditious tendency? Is it in their presence? No; a&nbsp;look,
a&nbsp;word, awes us into submission; and when we conceive the thoughts
of resistance we fly, like cowards, to some secret place, to some
neutral ground, to the desart heath of celibacy.</p>

<p>They may be accounted to possess the greatest talents who accomplish
the greatest purposes by few means, which, in my mind, establishes the
superiority of the fair sex. I&nbsp;am, Sir, your humble servant,</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> a ramble one
evening with her and her parents through a beautiful valley, our
admiration was excited by a cottage extremely small, but exquisitely
neat, which lay on the sloping bank of a meandering river, shaded by old
luxuriant trees<span class = "locked">---</span>a bridge composed of
planks formed a passage from the vale to the cottage, we crost it in
order to have a better opportunity of gratifying our curiosity. We now
saw a venerable looking man who had before escaped our notice, sitting
in a little sunny glade, we stopt for fear of intruding on his solitude,
but perceiving us he instantly approached, and with a pleasing
politeness requested we would enter his humble abode. Harley with
emotion exclaimed<span class = "locked">---</span>“Good God! surely that
voice is not unknown to me.” “I&nbsp;am certain,” said the stranger,
“I&nbsp;have seen you before, though where I cannot immediately
recollect.” “If I am not mistaken,” cried Harley, “You are the worthy
Hume who was chaplain to the regiment in which I served<ins class =

same indeed,” replied he, returning his embrace<span class =

attended with a train of the severest calamities.” The big tear stood
trembling on Harley’s cheek<span class = "locked">---</span>“Friend of
my youth,” said he<span class = "locked">---</span>his voice faultered,
but betrayed the sensibility of his feelings. We accompanied Mr. Hume
into his cottage, Harley and he appeared delighted with this unexpected
interview, both appeared anxious to learn the occurrences which had
past, during the long interval of a separation. Harley’s delicacy
prevented his enquiring too minutely into those misfortunes Hume hinted
at, which he, perceiving with a candour that seemed genuine to his
nature, declared he would inform us of those events he had experienced,
“a&nbsp;tale,” said he, “adapted for youth<span class =

<p>“The events of my life are uncommonly calamitous, misfortune has
persued me with unremitting vigour, I&nbsp;have lost the sweetest ties
of life, I&nbsp;have seen the form of loveliness mouldering away, the
shroud of darkness encompassing a mind replete with gentleness and pity,
I&nbsp;have beheld the inexorable ruffian rob innocence of its boast and
the blossom of beauty withering beneath the blast of affliction. Oh
Harley, I&nbsp;have endured all this, and yet I live<span class =

my fate.”</p>

<p>“The evening was uncommonly serene when I wandered from my cottage to
enjoy its balmy sweetness, the distant hum of the busy villagers
retiring from their various occupations, just stole upon my ear, and
made me reflect on the happiness of our English peasants, and that a
life of industry was a life of peace, since it kept the mind employed,
and prevented the thoughts from wandering beyond the boundaries of
virtue.</p>

<p>“I raised my eyes to the bright firmament where joys eternal are
treasured for the righteous&mdash;I considered that millions of
celestial beings might at that moment be hovering over my head, and
joining in responsive hallelujahs before the throne of the Almighty,

</div>

<p>“I was roused from my meditations by a piteous voice, demanding the
aid of charity, I&nbsp;looked at the object, he was a worn out veteran,
the remnant of a shabby scarlet coat hung over his feeble limbs, he
carried a wallet, no great load indeed, a&nbsp;mouldy crust of bread,
too hard for decaying jaws of age. I&nbsp;felt for his misery,
I&nbsp;pitied the misfortunes of that man, whose arm had assisted in
defending my country from the rapacity of its enemies. He told me a tale
of woe, and his cheek was moistened in relating it. Alas! poor old man,
cried I, you have not been exempt from the common lot; but cheer up my
soldier, the manly heart, while it trusts in heaven, should never be
deprest, but the anguish of poverty has weakened courage. Come, cried I,
taking him by the arm, we have both been veterans, though in different
ways, labour should now cease, age requires a relaxation from toil, we
are both swiftly gliding down the vale of years, let us endeavour to
make the passage easy, we will retire to my little cottage, its doors
have never yet refused admittance to the stranger, seated by the humble
fire-side, we will recount our tales of old, and cheer our hearts with a
draught of are, administered by the cherub hands of my Patty. We
ascended the hill together which led to my lowly mansion, nature had
sweetly decked it with the choicest verdure. As I ascended the hill,
I&nbsp;wondered at not beholding my Patty; it was her custom, when
prevented to attend my rambles, to watch my return, seated on the little
green turf beside the door. As I entered I called her, but received no
answer, my surprise increased<span class = "locked">---</span>I seated
my humble guest, and went in search of her, I&nbsp;tapt at her chamber
door, still all was silent<span class = "locked">---</span>melancholy
presages rushed upon me, I&nbsp;attempted to open the door, weak and
trembling my hand fell by my side, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page262" id = "page262">262</a></span>
my heart smote against my breast, I&nbsp;recollected myself, and
wondered what had excited such fears in me<span class =
"locked">---</span>they now died away like the shadows of the night,
I&nbsp;entered the chamber, but my child was not there, a&nbsp;folded
paper lay on her little dressing table, I&nbsp;hastily snatched it up
and perused it, a&nbsp;deep groan was wrung from me by agonizing pangs,
and I fell senseless on the floor, my fall reached the veteran’s ears,
he hurried to my assistance, gratitude inspired his poor unfortunate
bosom, and he endeavoured to aid me, he recalled me to life, ah!
mistaken kindness, the gloomy recesses of the grave were alone fit for
me. I&nbsp;started from his arms, I&nbsp;raved aloud upon the name of
Patty. Whither art thou gone, my child? I&nbsp;cried. The paper lay
before me, I&nbsp;imagined it all a dream, I&nbsp;strained my glimmering
sight to read the words of horror it contained:</p>

<p>“Oh my father, I fly from you, incapable of witnessing the shame and
sorrow I have drawn upon you, I&nbsp;fly from you, a&nbsp;stranger to
peace and bereft of innocence, the wiles of Mordaunt have undone me,
I&nbsp;leave you forever!”</p>

<p>“Perfidious villain, to blast my only comfort! With some degree of
resignation I could have consigned my child to death, the idea she was
gone spotless to the bosom of her creator, would have calmed the sorrows
of my soul, but to have her seduced by a monster, her fair form, her
virtue for ever blasted, oh! ’twas agony insupportable, she was
consigned to me by the wife on whom I doated; my Emily was an angel
before she left this world, prepared for the mandate which called her
hence, adorned with every charm of beauty and goodness, with her last
sigh, she grieved forth the united names of child and husband, the
cypress which shaded her grave was oftener watered by my tears, than by
the dews of heaven; Patty was the darling of my eye, the blooming
resemblance of her departed mother, she was sincere, artless, and
unsuspecting as credulity itself, she became acquainted with her
seducer, in our neighborhood he was affluent, young and elegant, beneath
the mask of friendship and generosity, he concealed a mind deceitful and
vicious, he admired the beauty of my child, he gained her affections,
and rendered her forgetful of my early precepts, she fled, afraid to see
the person whose hopes she had blasted, fled from the arms which would
have sheltered her against the contumely of the world.</p>

<p>“I turned to the soldier, I beheld his tears of sympathy; he had seen
troops destroyed, individuals fall beneath the ruthless sword of an
enemy, but he had never beheld a lovely daughter, tempted from the arms
of an idolizing parent. I&nbsp;will go in search of my child,
I&nbsp;exclaimed, he offered his withered arm to support me, we
descended the hill together. At the bottom I stopt, my emotions were to
be compared to those which our first parents felt when driven from the
garden of Eden. The cottage on the hill was once the scene of all my
bliss with Emily, it was sacred because she resided in it; I&nbsp;have
felt an enthusiasm of pleasure in walking through those paths in which
she had trod, I&nbsp;wept, oh earth! I&nbsp;cried, where are thy joys,
thy comfort? Alas! How fallible,
<span class = "pagenum">262b</span>
how fleeting all thy blessings! I&nbsp;hurried on, the soldier followed
me. We wandered to various cottages, still the answer was repeated, they
had not seen such passengers as we described, travelling shortly
exhausted our little stock of money, in a few days shelter was refused
us, we crept under a hedge, and the rain wet our grey locks. The soldier
murmured his regret, it was hard, he said, he had served his country
faithfully, yet its ungrateful inhabitants barred their doors against
him. Be comforted, my companion, I&nbsp;cried, consider what the Saviour
of mankind has said, “the sparrows have their nests and the beasts their
dens, but the son of man has not wherewithal to lay his head.” And shall
we after so glorious an example, repine at not receiving shelter from a
few miserable wretches<ins class = "correction"

<h4>ESSAY on the Conduct of Men toward the FAIR SEX.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Every</span> generous man
should view the sentiments and actions of the fair sex in the most
favourable light. I&nbsp;can ascribe the contrary practice to nothing
but an unmanly spirit, since, in many cases, those guilty of it cannot
vindicate themselves confidently with the laws of delicacy. Nature has
made man the protector; and the fair sex require his protection: he who
should refuse this, when necessary, would be reproached with cowardice;
and much more if he should take advantage of their weakness. But is not
he who injures a woman’s character, to be esteemed as great a coward as
he who assaults her person? Certainly he is: the former is an insult on
the modesty, and the latter upon the natural weakness of the sex.</p>

<p>There is but one way in which we can suppose a lady may vindicate
herself from a false imputation, and that is by the tenor of her
actions. But then, how liable are actions to be misconstrued! When once
a slanderous tongue has given the clue, the world will be too apt to
ascribe every thing to a wrong principle; even the candid are sometimes
misled, and form suspicions which their honour would otherwise have
prevented.</p>

<p>The practice of viewing the female conduct in an unfavourable light,
subjects the sex to many disadvantages, which I have observed in the
course of my acquaintance.</p>

<p>Flattery is a fashionable snare to entangle female vanity; and I know
of no method more successful, when a man is disposed to put an
unfavourable construction upon every thing he sees. If it is received
with applause, with what satisfaction does the base deceiver
congratulate himself upon his success! Hence some ladies, to avoid all
such appearances, shew themselves displeased when they are attacked in
this way; but alas! they succeed no better than the former; for it is
easy enough for the confident fellow to console himself with this
reflection, that the vain creature takes the compliment almost before it
was intended.</p>

<h4>To Mr. MICHAEL DE MARIBUS,</h4>

<p class = "center">In answer to his Grammatical Epistle addressed to

<p class = "inset smallcaps">Sir,</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> charitable
construction which has been put upon your <i>grammatical</i> epistle,
has <i>rendered</i> me <i>declinable</i> to your complex proposition. As
your presumptuous address, wholly precludes the necessity of an apology
for this abrupt preface; I&nbsp;shall be thereby relieved from an
embarrassment, which the delicacy of the subject would have otherwise
occasioned. The various contradictions visible in your letter, argue a
defect of sincerity. In the first place, you say you would be
<i>superlatively</i> happy to <i>agree</i> with me in the <i>subjunctive
mood</i>; then you seem disposed, with an assuming air, so throw in a
<i>conjunction disjunctive</i>, and disunite us into various
<i>moods</i> and <i>tenses</i>. Again you say that you do not wish to be
a <i>noun adjective</i>; then, that it is the <i>optative</i> of your
soul, to become a <i>relative</i>.&mdash;What is a <i>relative</i> pray,
but a <i>noun adjective?</i> You say also, that you trust I will not
opiniate you <i>singular</i>: if you are not in the <i>singular
number</i>, you must necessarily be in the <i>plural</i>. If, then, you
have already formed the <i>plural number</i>, by the <i>interjection</i>
of a <i>copulative conjunction</i>, connecting you to a <i>noun
substantive</i>, you cannot expect, or even wish from me, an accession
to your <i>proposition</i>. I candidly declare to you, that a <i>noun
substantive</i> in the <i>singular number</i>, is the only <i>part of
speech</i> to which I would willingly <i>subjoin</i> a <i>copulative
conjunction</i>. Lest you should be disposed to charge me with assuming
the prerogative of your own sex, I&nbsp;shall pass over many expressions
in your letter, which might properly afford a field for criticism. But
let me add, Sir, that as it was an impolite, so was it a very impolitic
thing for you to make use of such unwarranted freedom, as to make
proposals of so immensely great consequence, to a person, with whom you
had so slight an acquaintance. If, previous to the exhibition of your
bold letter, you had perfectly learned my <i>disposition</i>, you must
have been sensible, that it would be far from being <i>consonant</i>
with my feelings to admit of a <i>concord</i> with you, upon conditions
so disagreeable as those you offered. Beside, it would have been by no
means a bad plan for you, to have been a little conversant with my
sister <i>analogy</i>; as she might have been of considerable advantage
to you in an attempt of this nature: She might, at least, have supplied
you with a <i>rule</i>, by which two <i>noun substantives</i> might have
<i>agreed</i> with each other, without transforming either into a
<i>noun adjective</i>.</p>

<h4>MAN’S DANGER AND SECURITY IN YOUTH.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> that period of
life too often characterised by forward presumption and headlong
pursuit, self-conceit is the great source of these dangers to which men
are exposed; and it is peculiarly unfortunate, that the age which stands
most in need of the counsel of the wise, should be the most prone to
contemn it. Confident in the opinions which they adopt, and in the
measures which they pursue, the bliss which youth aim at, is, in their
opinion fully apparent. It is not the danger of mistake, but the failure
of success, which they dread. Activity to seize, not sagacity to
discern, is the only requisite which they value.</p>

<p>The whole state of nature is now become a scene of delusion to the
sensual mind. Hardly any thing is what it appears to be: and what
flatters most is always farthest from reality. There are voices which
sing around us, but whose strains allure to ruin. There is a banquet
spread where poison is in every dish. There is a couch which invites us
to repose, but to slumber upon it is death. Sobriety should temper
unwary ardour; Modesty check rash presumption; Wisdom be the offspring
of reflection now, rather than the bitter fruit of experience
hereafter.</p>


<p class = "twin w33">&nbsp;</p>

<h4><span class = "extended">DECEIT</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">That</span> darkness of
character, where we can see no heart, those foldings of art, through
which no native affection is allowed to penetrate, present an object
unamiable in every season of life, but particularly odious in youth. If
at an age when the heart is warm, when the emotions are strong, and when
nature is expected to shew itself free and open, we can already smile
and deceive, what is to be expected, when we shall be longer hackneyed
in the ways of men, when interest shall have compleated the obduration
of our hearts, and experience shall have improved us in all the arts of
guile!</p>

<p>Dissimulation in youth is the forerunner of perfidy in old age: its
first appearance is the fatal omen of growing
<span class = "pagenum">265b</span>
depravity and future shame. It degrades parts and learning, obscures the
lustre of every accomplishment, and sinks us into contempt with God and
man. The path of falsehood is a perplexing maze. After the first
departure from sincerity, it is not in our power to stop. One artifice
unavoidably leads on to another: till, as the intricacy of the labyrinth
increases, we are left entangled in our own snare.</p>

<p>Deceit discovers a little mind, which stops at temporary expedients,
without rising to comprehensive views of conduct. It betrays a dastardly
spirit. It is the resource of one who wants courage to avow his designs,
or to rest upon himself. To set out in the world with no other principle
than a crafty attention to interest, betokens one who is destined for
creeping through the inferior walks of life. He may be fortunate, he
cannot be happy; the eye of a good man will weep at his error: he cannot
taste the sweets of <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘confidental’">confidential</ins> friendship, and his evening of life
will be embittered by universal contempt.</p>


<p class = "twin w33">&nbsp;</p>

<h4>DUTY OF OLD AGE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A material</span> part of
the duty of the aged consists in studying to be useful to the race who
are to succeed them. Here opens to them an extensive field, in which
they may so employ themselves as considerably to advance the happiness
of mankind. To them it belongs to impart to the young the fruit of their
long experience; to instruct them in the proper conduct, and to warn
them of the various dangers of life; by wise counsel to temper their
precipitate ardour, and both by precept and example to form them to
piety and virtue.</p>

<p>It never appears with greater dignity, than when tempered with
mildness and enlivened with good humour; it then acts as a guide and a
patron of youth.</p>

<p>Religion, displayed in such a character, strikes the beholders, as at
once amiable and venerable. They revere its power, when they see it
adding so much grace to the decays of nature, and shedding so pleasing a
lustre over the evening of life. The young wish to tread in the same
steps, and to arrive at the close of their days with equal honour.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“I stood</span> on the deck
a prey to speechless agony, when suddenly somebody tapped me on the
shoulder. Conceive my astonishment when, on turning round, I&nbsp;saw
Alumbrado standing behind me. I&nbsp;staggered back as if a midnight
spectre had taken hold of me with icy hands. Terror and surprise
deprived me of the power of utterance, and suspended every motion of my
limbs. He had made the voyage without my knowledge, and found means to
keep himself concealed from me; you may therefore imagine, how violently
I was affected by the sudden appearance of that man, whom I fancied to
be at Lis*on.</p>

<p>“Are you not sorry now, that you have slighted my advice?” Alumbrado
said, “it seems you will not see your friend in this world.” Some
minutes passed before I was able to reply. “Let us now enjoy in silence
the grandest spectacle that nature can <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘offord’">afford</ins>!” So saying, he looked with
tranquillity at the foaming ocean, as if he had been standing on the
sheltering shore, far distant from the danger that surrounded us from
all sides. His eyes beheld with inconceivable serenity the wild
commotion of the waves, which now raised the vessel to the flaming
clouds, and now hurled it into the gaping abyss of the boiling sea. The
firm tranquillity which Alumbrado’s countenance bespoke, in spite of the
furious combat of the elements, the impending destruction of the ship,
and the doleful lamentations of the desponding crew, appeared to me to
denote more than human courage. I&nbsp;gazed with secret awe at a being
that seemed to be delighted with a spectacle, which made every hair of
my head rise like bristles.</p>

<p>‘At length the flashes of lightning grew fainter, the roaring of the
thunder less violent, and the fury of the winds seemed to be exhausted;
but the sea continued to be agitated in so dreadful a manner, that we
apprehended the cables would not be able to stand the motion of the ship
any longer. In vain did we implore human assistance by the discharge of
our guns, the towering waves threatening destruction to the boats that
attempted to come to our relief.</p>

<p>“In vain will human force endeavour to wage the unequal contest
against all-powerful nature!” I&nbsp;exclaimed when I beheld that
desponding sight. Alumbrado turned round. “I&nbsp;will tame the fury of
these foaming waves, if you will promise to return to <ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">Lis*on!”</ins> I gazed at him
in speechless astonishment. “I&nbsp;am in earnest,” he resumed, “will
you return to Lis*on?” “If I will?” I&nbsp;replied, “If I will? how can
you ask me that question? enable me to do it!” Alumbrado left me without
returning an answer.</p>

<p>‘A few minutes after he returned. <ins class = "correction" title =
"open quote missing">“You</ins> will, presently, behold a miracle,” he
said, “but I must request you to tell nobody the author of&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>‘I promised it, and the miracle ensued. The rolling
<span class = "pagenum">266b</span>
foaming sea grew calm and smooth. We went on shore, and found ourselves
not farther than a day’s journey from Lis*on.</p>

<p>‘You see my friend, that a higher power, against which opposition
would have been useless, has put a stop to my voyage. I&nbsp;have
related the history of it without making any comments, and leave it to
your own judgment to form a just opinion of it. As for me, I&nbsp;am
convinced that I have at length found the man whom my boding soul has
long been in search&nbsp;of.’</p>

<p>This letter astonished me to the highest degree, and, at the same
time, augmented my apprehensions very much. In my answer I declared
neither for nor against Alumbrado’s supernatural power, because I
neither chose to confirm the Duke in his belief in it, nor to risk
losing his confidence; for how could I have expected to receive farther
intelligence of his connection with Alumbrado, if I had been deprived of
the latter? and yet it was of the utmost importance to me to learn every
transaction of that designing man.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this precaution, near a month elapsed without my
having received an answer to my letter. I&nbsp;wrote a second time to
him, but before his answer could reach me, was ordered by the King to
return instantly, and to make an oral report of the issue of my
commission. I&nbsp;was, therefore, obliged to depart without being able
to wait the arrival of his letter.</p>

<p>I anticipated the pleasure of surprising him by my unexpected
arrival, and went to his palace as soon as I arrived at Lis*on. He
rather seemed surprised than pleased at the unexpected sight of me,
asking with a kind of anxiety, whether I had received his last letter.
When I answered in the negative he seemed to grow more easy, but adding,
some time after, that it would be sent after me without delay, his brow
began again to be overclouded. I was not much pleased with this
behaviour, and begged him to relate to me the sequel of <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has superfluous ,">Alumbrado’s</ins> history,
but he desired me to await the arrival of his letter, in which I should
find a circumstantial account of it. In vain did I conjure him by the
ties of our friendship to gratify my desire, and tried every art of
persuasion in order to get the wished for information. He always evaded
my questions, and frequently betrayed strong marks of uneasiness.
Displeased with this reserve and mysterious behaviour, I&nbsp;took leave
with evident coolness.</p>

<p>The two following days elapsed without our seeing each other.
I&nbsp;must not forget to mention, that I received, the second day after
my arrival, a&nbsp;letter from an unknown hand. When I opened the cover,
I&nbsp;found a second sealed letter along with the following lines which
were directed to&nbsp;me:</p>

<p>“Tomorrow you will receive a visit of an old acquaintance, to whom
you will have the kindness to deliver the inclosed letter. But if he
should not have made his appearance on the day after to-morrow, you may
open the letter, which will give you farther information.”</p>

<p>I could guess neither the writer of the note, nor who that old
acquaintance could&nbsp;be.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page267" id = "page267">267</a></span>
<p>The day following I received the Duke’s letter, which had been sent
after me. I&nbsp;opened it with impatience, and read the following
lines:</p>

<p>“It appears more and more probable to me, my friend, that Alumbrado
has raised the tempest that threatened to prove fatal to me, in order to
punish me for my disobedience to his advice. For should he, who can
subdue the billowing waves, not also be able to agitate them? You may
say whatever you choose, a&nbsp;supernatural power must have been
concerned in that event, and who is capable to fix its extention, its
limits? My father and myself venerate Alumbrado as a worker of miracles
ever since that event, although he strives to hide himself behind the
pious cloak of humility.</p>

<p>“O! why was Alumbrado not present when that tempest raged which
deprived me of my Amelia? He would have saved her, and all the gods of
earth would envy me for my felicity. The Irishman has cheated me of
every earthly blessing, by not fulfilling his promise.</p>

<p>“Concerning the Irishman, Alumbrado has given me a very extraordinary
hint. ‘The Marquis of F*’ said he, ‘is undoubtedly right when he
maintains, that God never intrusts an impostor with the power of working
miracles. He is however mistaken, if he thinks the speaking phantom,
which Hiermanfor made appear at the church-yard, had been nothing else
but a natural deception; no one will ever persuade me that it is
possible to effect any thing of that kind by natural means. Effected by
mere natural means, you will say, and yet no miracle? certainly not; for
cannot Hiermanfor have deluded you by the assistance of the father of
lies? I&nbsp;will not explain my opinion on that head more at large, yet
I think the Irishman is an hypocritical villain, who carries on a wicked
trade. One ought to congratulate you, that your good principles deterred
him from initiating you in his shocking mysteries. It was not without
reason that he accused you of want of self-subsistence and resolution,
for a dreadful degree of firmness of soul is required for joining in a
contract whereby mortal men bid defiance to the great eternal Ruler of
the world. However your better genius watched over you, and although you
have been entangled a long time in the bonds of wickedness, yet he has
delivered you from those snares before they were tied indissolubly. You
ought to be thankful to the mercy of the God of love, and to be on your
guard in future. If you should meet with men who perform supernatural
works, you may easily find out what sort of people they are; if they
deal in lies and imposition, they belong to the kingdom of darkness, but
if truth and justice is sacred to them, they are children of light. If
you had examined the Irishman after this standard, you would have fled
with terror from the apparition of the church-yard, and he would never
have succeeded in entangling you in an undertaking which has deprived
the King of Spa*n of his lawful crown. The doctrine and the principles
of the Irishman ought to have rendered him suspected to you. He
endeavoured to point out to you <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged: London and Dublin books both have ‘_reason_’ (one word, italicized)">the reason</ins> as the only infallible instructor and
<span class = "pagenum">267b</span>
guide, at the expence of faith, and at the same time strove to confound
that very reason by artful and fallacious conclusions, as the Marquis of
F* has demonstrated in a masterly manner. The Irishman was very careful
not to make you reflect on the limits of reason and the power of men,
because a genius like you would easily have concluded how much we are in
want of divine illumination and grace; and it was his chief aim to
remove the light of religion, because his works required being covered
by delusive mists. You will never have seen him frequent the church, nor
perform religious rites, will never have heard him pronounce certain
sacred names. I&nbsp;know that sort of people, who are so much the more
dangerous, the more they are skilled in concealing their real shape
behind deceiving masks. The spreading libertinism, and the furious rage
of explaining every thing naturally, threatens indeed to suspend the
belief in the existence, nay even in the possibility of miracles and
sorcery, however they have not ceased notwithstanding that. The opinions
of men may alter, but things will remain as they are. The same
Omnipotence that in times of old has led the Israelites through the red
sea, manifests itself still in our days through signs and miracles,
although they are not acknowledged as such by the blind multitude. The
same reprobated spirit that spoke formerly through the oracle of
Delphos, and by whose assistance Simon the magician performed
extraordinary feats, is still active in our present times.</p>

<p>“Is it therefore, improbable that men who by their superior sanctity
rise above the generality, and connect themselves more intimately with
the Godhead, should resemble the Supreme Being in power, and enjoy an
immediate influence of the Ruler of the world? Is it so very
incomprehensible that the spirit of darkness should favour those who
resemble him in wickedness, and endow their inclination of perpetrating
wicked deeds with a physical power of executing their diabolical
designs? People of either description will, indeed, always rarely be met
with; superstition will mistake as such many who do not belong to that
class, yet who can prove that they do not exist at all? I&nbsp;am,
certainly, no enemy to reason, however I conceive it to be not less
absurd obstinately to reject whatever is miraculous, than to believe it

even where reason finds nothing but midnight darkness. While the latter

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Happiness</span> is more
sought after, and with much greater avidity, than any other blessing
with which this terraqueous ball is supposed is be endued. Yet,
notwithstanding the eagerness with which it is pursued, none has been
less substantially obtained. The reason is obvious. Mankind are
dissatisfied with their respective situations in life, and content
dwells not in their bosoms: their minds are satiated with what they
possess; new objects hardly delight for a moment, ere fresh ones present
themselves; and man, unthinking creature as he is, follows the airy
phantom, promising himself perfect happiness, can he but attain another
wish; but which, when acquired, proves, alas! like the former, the
visionary satisfaction of an instant.</p>

<p>Content constitutes continual happiness; for with that sweet
companion, the peasant is greater than a prince destitute of the benign
blessing. The glittering, gaudy tinsel of a court, is unable to convey
that real happiness to man, which the honest rustic feels at the sweet
lispings of his innocent babes, and the heartfelt welcome of a faithful
wife as they greet his return every evening from a hard day’s toil.
Surrounded by this happy group, he sits down, breaks the bread of
virtuous industry, blesses Him who gave him strength to earn the scanty
meal, and lays down on the pallet of penury in peace, to arise with the
morn to labour and to happiness. This life he enjoys, because he aspires
to nothing above that sphere in which it has pleased Omnipotence to
place him.</p>

<p>How few, even in any state, do we find happy? Alas! the number is by
far too few. To the improper pursuit after happiness, can we only
attribute the misery of mankind; daily, nay even hourly, do we see dread
examples of this serious truth. But where is the eye that has not
beheld, the mind that has not felt, or the heart that has not pitied,
some object who has, in grasping at the shadow of happiness, lost the
substance; whether it has met the observation as a culprit at the bar of
a criminal court, a&nbsp;lunatic, a&nbsp;beggar, a&nbsp;deluded female,
or a debtor in the dreary mansion of a prison? Where is the tongue but
must confess, that they have lost their probity, their reason, their
independence, their virtue, or their liberty, in an improper pursuit
after happiness? However wrong their ideas might be, that, and that
only, was the aim.</p>

<p>It will be asked, and with great propriety, what remedy we should
apply for the prevention or cure of such an unremitting disease? We can
only recommend content; not merely as the interest, but the duty of
mankind. For, if man repines, at whom is it? It is at Him who in mercy
infinite made man. There are few, it is presumed, if they consider this
serious and important truth, who will not cease to murmur and be
discontented; or they must, at least, cease to offend the Almighty, by
repeating those words which his beloved Son himself hath taught us,
saying, “thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.”</p>

<h4 class = "smallcaps">Of the GENIUS of the ARABS.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Arabia</span> has ever been
as celebrated for horses of a gentle, generous spirit, as the Arabs for
their skill in training them. That this praise is not undeserved,
nothing can more clearly illustrate, I&nbsp;conceive, than the following
incident, recounted by an English gentleman, whose credit and repute are
well known among his countrymen in Bengal.</p>

<p>Temporarily resident at Bussorah, after a trading voyage to the Gulph
of Persia, Mr. <span class = "locked">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> went, one
afternoon, to pay a visit at the English factory. Whilst the Chief, with
several other gentlemen besides himself, were drinking coffee in a
balcony, an Arab, gallantly mounted, and his horse superbly caparisoned,
galloped into the courtyard: there, for some time, he exercised his
steed, displayed perfect address in the manege, curvetting, prancing,
volting, wheeling, and caprioling his courser, with inimitable grace,
and as much expertness in the easy management of his arms, darting a
spear in the air, and recovering it again at full tilt, with other
feats, equally dexterous and entertaining.</p>

<p>Unluckily, however, for the poor fellow, in crossing a bank and
ditch, leading from the area to an adjacent field, the horse, being
fatigued, fell down, and threw his rider headlong in the dust.
A&nbsp;stream of blood gushed, at the same time, from the creature’s
nostrils, and he lay extended and motionless on the ground. The Arab
seemed stunned by the fall; but at length recovering, shook his ears,
brushed the dust from his cloaths, replaced his turban, and approached
his horse.</p>

<p>But no man nor pencil can express the anguish and affliction
conspicuous in the man’s countenance, on beholding the animal lie in
that condition. At first he raved and screamed, in a delirium of agony;
then bursting into tears, kissed and embraced his horse, bewailing and
bemoaning his loss in all the excess of despondency. So animated,
indeed, appeared his grief, and so deep his distress, as to inspire a
sympathetic affection in the bosoms of all the spectators.</p>

<p>The gentlemen instantly called him up, and learning that the horse
had been bred from a colt in his house, and was the only support (as the
man served as a monthly Sepahi in the Bashaw’s army) of his father,
mother, himself, his wife, and three small children, and that the loss
now deprived the whole of subsistence, they humanely raised a handsome
contribution for him, immediately among themselves and their dependents,
and, giving the man the money, bid him be comforted, and go and buy
another horse.</p>

<p>With effusions of the most lively gratitude, yet not unaccompanied by
sighs and sobs, the man received the bounty, and once more repaired,
dejectedly, towards his horse, in order, as it should seem, to take off
the trappings and furniture. But no sooner had the wily Arab repassed
the ditch, than, at a word, the horse started up; the master vaulted
upon his back, and rode away full speed, laughing aloud at the credulity
of his staring and astonished dupes, and at the success of his own
contrivance.</p>

<p class = "center extended">[<span class = "smallest">WRITTEN BY

<p class = "center smaller">
(Concluded from our last.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Be</span> consoled that our
hearts are not tainted with evil, and that the consciousness of never
committing aught offensive to innocence, hangs like a friendly shade
around us, to blunt the pointed arrows of adversity. Fatigue at length
overpowered the veteran, and he died under a holly tree.
A&nbsp;tributary tear of gratitude fell from me, but I quickly supprest
my feelings, and envied him his fate. The minister of the parish was a
good man, and had him interred. When the rustics retired who had
attended the funeral, I&nbsp;seated myself by the sod which covered the
remains of my last friend, how often did I raise my eyes to heaven, and
beseech the Supreme to take me to eternal peace. I&nbsp;continued lost
in gloomy reveries till night surrounded me, I&nbsp;arose with an
intention of proceeding to the next hamlet. As I walked slow and
pensive, my ears were struck by a soft voice familiar to them, which
came from a flower-woven arbour on the road side. I&nbsp;listened
attentively, it was the voice of my child, amazed, doubting my own
senses, I&nbsp;crept to the spot. She was singing a little air, which
had once been a favourite of mine, there is no describing the melancholy
melody with which she sung it; she was often interrupted by sighs, and
her hands were raised to wipe away her tears, the beams of the moon
shone around us, affording sufficient light to discern every object. She
turned around and perceived me, the paleness and agony of my countenance
terrified her, “Gracious Heaven!” cried she, “what do I behold?”
“A&nbsp;miserable old man,” I&nbsp;exclaimed, “whose heart is broken by
ingratitude and grief.” She shrieked, she would have fled, but her limbs
aided not her intention, fainting she sunk at my feet, I&nbsp;knelt
beside her, I&nbsp;clasped her with a kind of phrenzy to my breast,
called upon her to revive, and bless a father who never ceased to regret
her loss, she opened her eyes, “Alas! I&nbsp;am unworthy of such
tenderness,” “No, my child, mercy is the sweetest attribute of heaven,
to err, the weakness of humanity.” Her head fell upon my shoulder,
I&nbsp;wept with her, my heart seemed breaking, at that moment comfort
seemed fled from both for ever. By degrees I calmed her agitation,
“Alas!” said she, “was it in search of such a wretch you came? oh! my
father, how could I ever forget thy precepts, or deviate from the path
in which you brought me up, but if penitence and remorse can palliate
error, mine is lessened, from the moment of error I have been
superlatively wretched, and incessantly looked back to regret that peace
which can only result from unsullied innocence.” A&nbsp;thousand times
the dear unhappy girl knelt at my feet, to implore my forgiveness,
I&nbsp;as often assured her she had obtained&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“Though peace and innocence,” said I, “shall no more brighten my
cottage, yet pity and repentance shall render it not an unpleasing
asylum, but may some signal punishment from <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘heayen’">heaven</ins>, fall upon the author of your
wrongs.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">269b</span>
<p>The shocks my Patty had experienced preyed upon her life, unceasing
anguish like a worm in the bud, fed on her damask cheek, the glow of
health, the fire of imagination, and the animation of youth were fled,
and a deep melancholy seized the soul of my child, she in whom my life
was wrapt, whom I had nourished with so much tenderness, lay expiring
before me, like a blossom immaturely blighted, I&nbsp;attended her in
dumb despair. A&nbsp;few moments before she died, she thus spoke, “Alas
my father, I&nbsp;have overwhelmed you with sorrow, regret me not, let
not those tears fall on my account, in this world all must have been
misery, the blackness of despair, I&nbsp;go, blessed by thy forgiveness,
and the promise which scripture holds out of penitence meeting mercy,
a&nbsp;broken and contrite heart is acceptable.” Her hands were
extended, her eyes closed, and she expired. The power who supported me
in such trials, pardoned the first delirium of grief, in the days of my
felicity I had pictured to myself such scenes of bliss, I&nbsp;looked
forward to a prattling progeny, who would be the comfort of my old
age.</p>

<p>“How desultory are the schemes of man, he lays plans of permanent
felicity, when the whirlwind of affliction arrives, and destroys the
towering edifice of creative hope.</p>

<p>“After those occurrences, my mind was too perturbed to allow me to
attend to the duties of my function, I&nbsp;surrendered my living, left
that part of the country, and retired to this spot, where unknown and
unmolested, I&nbsp;may brood over my losses, and where I frequently
picture to myself the terminating scene.”</p>

<p>Exquisite were the sensations of grief and horror, which this little
tale excited in our breasts; to my feelings was added a painful degree
of surprise from the name of Mordaunt, I&nbsp;enquired, though in
accents of dread and hesitation, and learned he was the destroyer of
<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘Humes’s’">Hume’s</ins>
happiness.</p>

<p>Our visits were frequently repeated to the cottage of the unfortunate
old man, to me they were inexpressibly soothing, from kindred grief
there was derived a congenial sympathy.</p>

<p>Two years had rolled away since my retirement in Harley’s cottage,
when I was called down one morning to a gentleman in the parlour, my
heart trembled at the summons, and my tottering limbs could scarcely
support me to the spot. A&nbsp;stranger in deep mourning met my view,
I&nbsp;gazed attentively on him, and recollected the features of my
brother, grief had so altered my form, so worn away all traces of my
former self, that he knew me not, till my weak voice pronounced his
name.</p>

<p>“Ah my sister,” cried he, “think not your brother could ever forget
your gentle worth, could ever think you deserving of censure, or like
the world be biassed by misfortune to forget you, a&nbsp;father’s
interdiction prevented me ere this, visiting your retreat, that father
no longer exists to oppose my intentions, he died convinced of your
innocence, and breathing wishes for your felicity. Harland, the penitent
Harland is no more, sensible of the injustice he had done you, he
acknowledged his cruelty,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page270" id = "page270">270</a></span>
and has by his death, restored you to fame, to fortune, and to your
child.”</p>

<p>I wept as my brother spoke&mdash;my heart was opprest by a variety of
emotions, and my gloomy soul turned to the untimely grave of
Harland&mdash;my brother conjectured my feelings&mdash;“I see” cried he,
“from what a mingled source your tears flow, but ah my sister, in this
life happiness must ever receive some alloy.”</p>

<p>His consolations strengthened my reason in combating grief&mdash;I
reflected that even if Harland lived, to me he must have been lost,
since after the unfortunate rencontre between him and my husband,
a&nbsp;connection with him would have confirmed an invidious world in
every idea they had formed prejudicial to&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>He was soon struck by the charms and innocent simplicity of Louisa,
her heart returned his partiality, and I had the happiness of witnessing
their union.</p>

<p>Their happiness, the education of my child, and self-exertion, roused
me from the lethargy of grief, and diffused a calm over my mind I never
hoped to have experienced.</p>

contemplate the inimitable works of creation, is no less instructive

of entertaining ideas, equally calculated to raise in the souls of human
beings the most unfeigned offerings of wonder, gratitude, and praise.
The gaiety of spring, the smiles of summer, the fecundity of autumn, and
the dreariness of winter, all combine to celebrate the Author of
universal existence. From the most curious and precious earthly
substance, down to the simplest blade of herbage, a&nbsp;granery is
opened to satisfy the desires of, and impart delight to, rational
mortals. But, notwithstanding the innumerable blessings conferred on man
from above, if we attentively mark the conduct of the majority of
individuals, painful as it may be to our own feelings, or those of every
contemplative, virtuous, and sensible person, how few are those to be
found, who are truly thankful for the mercies they enjoy? How few,
indeed, who acknowledge the goodness of an omnipotent and omniscient
Being! They live as if they were indebted to none for their life or
their enjoyments. Unthankful and ungenerous man! why art thou so impious
as to forget that incumbent gratitude, and that graceful duty, which
thou
<span class = "pagenum">270b</span>
owest to thy heavenly Father? Why trample on every moral obligation? why
shun the precepts of pious Wisdom, and the dictates of impartial
Conscience? Rouze thyself from the torpor which now envelopes thee, and
learn to be thankful for those blessings which thou dost assuredly
receive from above; and, in the words of the late pious Mr. Addison,

<p>Let not any one think it beneath him, or in the smallest degree
derogatory to his character or sphere in life, however learned, opulent,
and exalted, he may be, to retire occasionally from the bustle of the
world, and to meditate in some calm and undisturbed recess, the
perfections of his Maker, and the works of his hands. Believe me, the
most refined pleasures are to be derived from such innocent, delightful,
and laudable pursuits. The magnificent and wonderful objects of the
celestial, and the curiosity and variety of the vegetable world, as well
as the formation of all animals, reptiles, insects, and other
productions of Nature, have properties which, if accurately viewed,
yield inconceivable astonishment to the beholder. When spring, for
example, returns with all it’s native beauties, as succeeding the gloomy
aspect and forbidding horrors of winter; when it teems with a matchless
splendour and magnificence; when its green hues and universal verdure
come forth in all their pristine elegance, and enchanting attractions;
and the birds warble and attune in sprightly attitudes, their respective
notes, even then they are almost always either forgotten or disregarded;
even then men neglect to thank the Author of life and happiness, the
source of every distributive blessing. What culpable negligence is this,
in rational and accountable beings! O&nbsp;that man would attend with
docility to these important truths, and frequently reflect on the
revolving seasons of the year, and the School of Nature, which would
afford him an endless variety of useful and instructive lessons; and, in

unasked,” says Lord Chesterfield, “is a piece of rudeness; it is, in
effect, declaring ourselves wiser than these to whom we give it;
reproaching them with ignorance and inexperience. It is a freedom that
ought not to be taken with any common acquaintance.” Notwithstanding,
there are those who assume the place of preceptors, not only to their
familiars, but to those with whom they have no particular acquaintance,
nor can claim the least pretence to superiority.</p>

<p>There is also another class of people who render themselves

resented.</p>

<p>An instance of both these characters I met with, not long since, in a

observations were altogether levelled at me, I&nbsp;shall not hesitate
to offer a few remarks thereon; and, in my turn, propose a word of
instruction to those who may be guilty of the like errors. Should they
wish to convince any one of his faults, on honourable grounds, let them,
without reserve, address the immediate person intended, with freedom and
candour: for they may be assured that open reproof is better than covert
insults. “Poisoned arrows,” (to use the words of a celebrated author, on
another occasion) “and stabs in the dark, are not more repugnant to the
laws of Humanity” than “this battery of” indirect sarcasm. Reflections,
thus obliquely delivered, though clothed in the “mildest language,” give
to persons of discernment and spirit “sensible” offence. Every body
knows that the provokingest things are frequently uttered in the ironic
style; and it is quite as certain, that the acutest sting often lurks
under the softest expressions. The dagger becomes not less keen for

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Almost</span> every object
that attracts our notice, has its bright and its dark side. He who
habituates himself to look at the displeasing side, will sour his
disposition, and, consequently, impair his happiness; while he who
constantly beholds it on the bright side, insensibly meliorates his
temper, and, in consequence of it, improves his own happiness, and the
happiness of all about him.</p>

<p>Arachne and Melissa are two friends. They are, both of them, women in
years, and alike in birth, fortune, education, and accomplishments. They
were originally alike in temper too; but, by different management, are
grown the reverse of each other. Arachne has accustomed herself to look
on the dark side of every object. If a new poem or play makes its
appearance with a thousand brilliances and but one or two blemishes, she
slightly skims over the passages that should give her pleasure, and
dwells upon those only that fill her with dislike. If you shew her a
very excellent portrait, she looks at some part of the drapery which has
<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘heen’">been</ins>
neglected, or to a hand or finger which has been left unfinished. Her
garden is a very beautiful one, and kept with great neatness and
elegancy: but, if you take a walk with her in it, she talks to you of
nothing but blights and storms, of snails and caterpillars, and how
impossible it is to keep it from the litter of falling leaves and
worm-carts. If you sit down in one of her temples, to enjoy a delightful
prospect, she observes to you, that there is too much wood, or too
little water; that the day is too sunny, or too gloomy: that it is
sultry, or windy; and finishes with a long harangue upon the
wretchedness of our climate.&mdash;When you return with her to the
company, in hopes of a little chearful conversation, she casts a gloom
over all, by giving you the history of her own bad health, or of some
melancholy accident that has befallen one of her daughter’s children.
Thus she insensibly sinks her own spirits, and the spirits of all around
her; and, at last, discovers, she knows not why, that her friends are
grave.</p>

<p>Melissa is the reverse of all this. By constantly habituating herself
to look only on the bright side of objects, she preserves a perpetual
chearfulness in herself, which, by a kind of happy contagion, she
communicates to all
<span class = "pagenum">273b</span>
about her. If any misfortune has befallen her, she considers it might
have been worse, and is thankful to Providence for an escape. She
rejoices in solitude, as it gives her an opportunity of knowing herself;
and in society, because she can communicate the happiness she enjoys.
She opposes every man’s virtues to his failings, and can find out
something to cherish and applaud in the very worst of her acquaintance.
She opens every book with a desire to be entertained or instructed, and
therefore seldom misses what she looks for. Walk with her, though it be
on a heath or a common, and she will discover numberless beauties,
unobserved before, in the hills, the dales, the brooms, brakes, and the
variegated flowers of weeds and poppies. She enjoys every change of
weather, and of season, as bringing with it something of health or
convenience. In conversation, it is a rule with her never to start a
subject that leads to any thing gloomy or disagreeable. You therefore
never hear her repeating her own grievances, or those of her neighbours
or, what is worst of all, their faults or imperfections. If any thing of
the latter kind be mentioned in her hearing, she has the address to turn
it into entertainment, by changing the most odious railing into a
pleasant raillery.</p>

<p>Thus Melissa, like the bee, gathers honey from every weed; while
Arachne, like the spider, sucks poison from the fairest flowers. The
consequence is, that, of two tempers once very nearly allied, the one is
ever sour and dissatisfied, the other always gay and chearful; the one
spreads an universal gloom, the other a continual sunshine.</p>

<p>There is nothing more worthy of our attention, than this art of
happiness. In conversation, as well as life, happiness, very often
depends upon the slightest incidents. The taking notice of the badness
of the weather, a&nbsp;North-East wind, approach of winter, or any
trifling circumstance of the disagreeable kind, shall infallibly rob a
whole company of its good-humour, and fling every member of it into the
vapours. If, therefore, we would be happy in ourselves, and are desirous
of communicating that happiness to all about us, these minutiæ of
conversation ought carefully to be attended to. The brightness of the
sky, the lengthening of the day, the increasing
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page274" id = "page274">274</a></span>
verdure of the spring, the arrival of any little piece of good news, or
whatever carries with it the most distant glimpse of joy, shall
frequently be the parent of a social and happy conversation.
Good-manners exact from us this regard to our company. The clown may
repine at the sunshine that ripens the harvest, because his turnips are
burnt up by it; but the man of refinement will extract pleasure from the
thunder-storm to which he is <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘epxosed’">exposed</ins>, by remarking on the plenty and refreshment
which may be expected from the succeeding shower.</p>

<p>Thus does politeness, as well as good sense, direct us to look at
every object on the bright side; and, by thus acting, we cherish and
improve both. By this practice it is, that Melissa is become the wisest
and best-bred woman living; and, by this practice, may every person
arrive at that agreeableness of temper, of which the natural and
never-failing fruit is Happiness.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> period is
however arrived, when men begin to abandon themselves exclusively to the
cold speculations of reason, and this fatal maxim manifests itself but
too evidently in the practical life. Rarely any thing is undertaken
before it is pondered and weighed most anxiously with a pusillanimous
minuteness. And this is one of the chief causes of the present scarcity
of great and striking actions. The sacred flame of enthusiasm
extinguishes, and every energy of soul dies away along with it. While
reason wastes her whole strength in barren speculations, the demands and
wants of our heart remain unsatisfied, a&nbsp;kind of insensibility
deals upon us, the mind grows pusillanimous, and all noble passions are
suffocated. No, no! this is no age in which great geniuses can thrive!
Reasoning has produced but very few immortal deeds; faith, however,
although it should have been only the faith of man in his natural
abilities, has frequently rendered impossible possible.&mdash;If so,
what miracles will faith in the assistance of an omnipotent being, be
able to perform? The first King of Portugal has given us the most
glorious proof of the truth of this assertion: he went, as you know from
history, with four thousand men against the infidels, and was opposed by
five kings with four hundred thousand Moors. Terror and dismay seized
his little army at this sight; however the celebrated apparition through
which God promised him the victory over his enemies, revived the broken
spirit of his troops. And what else but faith in this promise could have
made him risk and gain a battle, in which one man had to encounter an
hundred?”</p>

<p>“My dear Marquis, I have been interrupted again by the visit of a
great prelate, and, with your permission, shall communicate to you the
substance of what he has told me. The Jews, he said, have, as you will
<span class = "pagenum">274b</span>
know, offered to the new Regent, on his accession to the throne, to pay
a great sum of money to him, if he would grant them liberty to live and
to trade in the country as external Christians, without being persecuted
by the Inquisition. It would have been highly advantageous to religion,
if this liberty had been granted to the Jews; for although they should
have visited the Christian churches at first only for form’s sake, and
observed only the external rites of worship, yet many would have been
edified, and convinced of the truth of Christianity so irresistibly,
that they would have seriously embraced the Christian religion. The
Inquisitors themselves have intimated this to the King. However the
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I do not know how to call him, who cares
little for the propagation of faith, has refused to grant this petition
of the Jews. The Inquisition has informed the Pope of it; and the holy
father, who as yet has refused to acknowledge his royal authority, will
now have an additional reason for not confirming the usurped dignity of
a free thinker, who injures the interest of the church whenever
opportunity offers. I&nbsp;have, however, great reason to suspect that
our new King foments these dissensions designedly, for some horrid
purpose. Not contented with having alienated the nation from their
lawful Sovereign, he also endeavours to obtain an opportunity of
alienating them from the chief of the church. O&nbsp;Marquis!
O&nbsp;Duke! what gloomy prospects for all those who are resolved to
live and to die in the religion of their ancestors.</p>

<p>“Stop,” the Marquis exclaimed, “he shall not dare to carry matters to
that point; by heaven, he shall not.” My father had not yet ceased
giving vent to his indignation, when the other prelate, whom I mentioned
in my last letter, joined us. The two <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘pelates’">prelates</ins> were rejoiced to see each other, and
concealed their sentiments so little from each other, that they both
avowed their opinions of the new King without the least reserve.
‘I&nbsp;cannot conceive how you,’ said he, who had joined us, turning to
my father and me, ‘who are sprung from royal blood, can submit to the
humiliation of obeying a usurper, who will do every thing in his power
to humble your family as much as possible. Don’t you perceive that he
confers the highest dignities on other people, while he, out of a
cowardly policy, keeps his nearest relations at a distance, and in
profound submission? The King of Spa&mdash;n knows your merits, and is
capable of rewarding them properly. Who would not rather hold an
important office under the greatest Monarch, than live in inactivity and
obscurity, under the most insignificant King in Europe? These are the
sentiments of many nobles who are still firmly attached to their old
lawful Sovereign.’</p>

<p>“Dear Marquis, my heart is deeply afflicted, and strange ideas are
crossing my head. What must I do? Alumbrado says nothing, but commit
every thing to the paternal care of God.</p>

<p>“To day I received your letter, in which you reproach me for my long
silence. I&nbsp;am, however, not sorry that my letter, which I wanted to
send eight days ago, has been kept back through negligence, for now I
shall be able to conclude it with the relation of a most extraordinary
incident.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page275" id = "page275">275</a></span>
<p>“I used for some time to visit every evening our favourite spot
before the town, which always attracted me very much, partly by its
natural charms, and partly by the undisturbed solitude one enjoys there.
On the left side, a&nbsp;chain of hills, that form a beautiful group; on
the right, a&nbsp;wood, inclosing the extensive plain, and in the middle
the prospect of the distant blue mountains. You know what an enchanting
effect that spot produces, particularly at sun-set; and thither I took a
walk every evening. The way to that charming place is decorated with the
ruins of an old chapel, which partly is surrounded with a half decayed
wall. Approaching those ruins last evening, I&nbsp;saw Alumbrado step
forth with hasty paces. ‘Stop!’ he exclaimed, ‘do you know that you will
be a dead man if you proceed a step farther?’ Alumbrado’s unexpected
appearance, his intelligence, and the seriousness of his countenance
convulsed my nerves. ‘A&nbsp;dead man?’ I&nbsp;exclaimed. ‘Yes!’ said
he, ‘did I not foretell you that the King would vent his resentment
against you? If you go fifty steps farther, you will bleed under the
hands of his banditti. You stare at me,’ he continued. ‘If you wish to
be convinced of it, then follow me into the chapel, and let us change
cloaths; I&nbsp;shall pursue this path, wrapt in your cloak, and the
hired assassins will fall upon me, under the mistaken notion that I am
the person whom they have been ordered by the King to assassinate. If
you will ascend to the top of this turret, you may witness the whole
scene.’ I&nbsp;shuddered with horror, and peremptorily refused to submit
to it. ‘You need not to be under the least apprehension for my life,’ he
<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">replied.</ins> ‘All that I
desire of you is to make no noise when you see me fall, but to go

exchanged our dress, he saw me to the top of the turret, and left me.
I&nbsp;pursued him with anxious looks and beating heart.</p>

when I heard the report of a pistol, and saw him drop down, upon which
three ruffians darted forth from the bushes, gave him some stabs, and
carried him into the wood. I&nbsp;staggered down the narrow staircase by
which I had ascended the turret, and went home, thrilled with emotions
that surpass all power of description. I&nbsp;sat up till after
midnight, but no Alumbrado came; however, at six o’clock he entered my
apartment. I&nbsp;cannot describe what I felt on seeing him. He was
unhurt, but nevertheless I staggered back at the sight of him.
‘Alumbrado!’ said I, after a pause of dumb astonishment, ‘do I really
see you alive after the scene my eyes have witnessed last night?’
‘Pistols and daggers,’ he replied, ‘cannot hurt the man who is under the
immediate protection of God. Come,’ added he, ‘let us go to your
father.’</p>

<p>“I related to my parent the incident of the preceding night. He
seemed to be petrified. The cruel villainy of the King, and the
supernatural power of Alumbrado, appeared to have carried him beyond
himself; the thanks which he wanted to offer to the latter for the
preservation of my life, and curses against the King, hovered
<span class = "pagenum">275b</span>
at the same time on his lips; but he could not speak.</p>

<p>“Let us take a walk in the garden,” Alumbrado said. We went; but I
shall not repeat the conversation that took place. Yet I do not think
that Alumbrado has added fuel to the fire. ‘The Duke of <span class =

tribunal but that of God. No mortal dare lift up his hand against him
without the express command of God or his Vicegerent. I&nbsp;have
received no such order, and I think you neither. All that you can do is
to be on your guard against the King, and to mention to no one the
villainous transaction of last night. Will you promise this? Your own
safety requires it.’ We promised&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“I could not help manifesting my astonishment at Alumbrado’s
wonderful <ins class = "correction"

only those who are leagued with the spirit of darkness are proof against
fire-arms and swords, and that the children of light do not enjoy that
privilege? I&nbsp;will give you a proof of it; send for a gun and balls,
here is powder.’ So saying, he produced the powder horn which I had
missed some days. ‘You have,’ added he, ‘either lost it or it has been
stolen, for I have found it in the hands of the banditti.’ ‘What are you
going to do with balls and a gun?’ My father asked with marks of
astonishment. ‘That you shall see instantly,’ Alumbrado replied, ‘if you
only will send for both.’ I&nbsp;ordered Pietro to fetch my fowling
piece and a couple of balls out of my apartment. He returned with them,
and Alumbrado whispered in my ear to send him out of the room. Having
dismissed the servant, Alumbrado begged me to charge the gun, but
previously to examine carefully the powder and the balls. I&nbsp;did as
he had desired me, and the gun being charged, Alumbrado said to the
Marquis; ‘Now take the gun, my Lord, and fire it at me.’ My father was
almost petrified at this request, and having gazed at him a good while,
with looks of astonishment, exclaimed: ‘No! I&nbsp;never shall do any
thing of that kind!’ ‘Then you too are destitute of faith?’ Alumbrado
said, looking up to heaven. ‘O&nbsp;God, how degenerated even the
faithful adorers of thy son!’ ‘I&nbsp;have declined it out of no other
motive,’ the Marquis replied, ‘but because I will not tempt the
omnipotence of God.’ ‘The motive of my request is not temptation, but
the glory of God,’ Alumbrado replied. If I fall, then I am a daring
provoker of the Almighty, and deserve my fate; but if I remain unhurt,
you will have reason to conclude that the power of God has warded off
the ball, and know in what light to view me<ins class = "correction"

<h4>ANECDOTE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A French</span> nobleman
one day visiting a late famous duke, a favourite little dog bit his
lordship’s leg. “Fear nothing, my lord,” said the duke, “my dog never
bites.” On which his lordship, knocking down the little animal with a
violent blow of his cane, replied in the same tone of voice, “Fear
nothing, my lord, I&nbsp;never beat dogs.”</p>

<h4>THE PROVERBIALIST.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Home</span>, is a place,
either of happiness or misery. In my book of experimental wisdom,
I&nbsp;find a number of most excellent remarks, which, if remembered,
and reduced to practice, I&nbsp;am confident may be of service to
families.</p>

<p>Every person has some failings: Perfection is not to be looked for in
the present world. A&nbsp;great attention in husband and wife, to the
failings of each other, has a direct tendency to destroy or embitter
domestic enjoyments.</p>

<p>The ancients, sensible of this gave good advice, when they said that,
“The husband should hot see, and the wife should be blind.” And it is
evident, that many things which transpire in a family, had better not be
seen&mdash;if seen, not remembered, if remembered, yet not spoken of.
Again, to render families happy, there must be, “In the husband wisdom,
in the wife gentleness.” These are virtues indeed, which, when they
meet, cause families to shine with a peculiar lustre. Again, “Those
husbands are in heaven whose wives do not chide.” Certainly then, if it
is in the power of the wife to put her husband into heaven, since she
must be with him, and with him participate in all its joys, she will
forever remember this excellent proverb.</p>

<p>A consideration of the unhappy condition of those families, wherein
scolding is the principle employment, I&nbsp;should suppose would
stimulate every woman to attend to the above remarks. Only hear what the
Spaniards say, “Smoke, raining into a house, and a scolding wife, make a
man run out of doors.”<span class = "locked">---</span>The ladies will
pardon me, I&nbsp;trust, for introducing this proverb, since it
evidently implies, that a scolding wife alone, without rain and smoke,
does not render a house so intolerable, but that a man, at least if he
has a common share of patience, may possibly live in&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Again, that house is highly ornamented, and that family has many
enjoyments, in which the wife is as attentive to her domestic concerns,
as is the husband to his abroad. No person was ever made for idleness,
accordingly, it is positively affirmed in my book of wisdom, that “That
is the best gown, which goes up and down the house.” If there be any
women, who are unable to penetrate into the depth of this proverb, or to
comprehend its profound wisdom, I&nbsp;will endeavour to explain it. As
there are but a few gentlemen, whose finances are adequate to the
supporting of a woman who feels herself above a personal attention to
her family concerns, so in general, husbands are well pleased to see
their wives suitably active in the house. Husbands in general, love
their wives; and it gives them pleasure to see them blooming in health;
and they know that the idle drone is always sick, or full of
complaints.</p>

<p>Further, sometimes ladies, by doing nothing except eating of the
honey, reduce their husbands to poverty, and we read that, “When poverty
comes in at the door, love flies out at the window,” and I add, misery
comes in at every corner. It is best then to “Carry an even yoke.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">276b</span>
<p>Pough! why am I always so severely berating the women? Every body
knows they do not deserve it: And I assure the ladies that I have an
affection for them. I&nbsp;am fearful that I have not well considered
what I am about. It is well if I do not bring an “Old house about my
ears.” From this time forward, on consideration they will pardon me for
what I have already said, I&nbsp;solemnly promise that I will be more
cautious; and no more proverbs shall come out respecting them, unless
they come by accident.</p>

<p>Perhaps I shall make this lecture rather long, but I wish to give
some advice to heads of families respecting their children. We read,
that “Children are certain cares, but uncertain comforts.” They would,
however, oftener be comforts, if they had not, as the ancients say, “Too
much of their mothers blessing.” Alas! well it only came out edgwise,
therefore I have not broken my promise.</p>

<p>To prove that I had no evil intention, I will bring one proverb
greatly in favour of the ladies; “She spins well who breeds her children
well;” and as every woman knows that she breeds her children well, so it
is proved beyond all doubt, that every woman is a good <ins class =
"correction" title = "two words">house wife</ins>.</p>

<p>To be serious; set your children good examples. Be more anxious to
make them virtuous, than to leave them rich. The Spaniards say, that
“The father’s virtue is the best inheritance a son can have;” and if so,
surely to make the son himself virtuous is to make him rich indeed.
Again, “Leave your son a good reputation, and an employment.” This is
good advice, for children trained up without virtue, and without
employment, are fit only for the gallows. Again, “It is a bad house
which has not an old man in it.” The meaning is, that every man who has
a family, should have the soberness, gravity, and virtues of the
aged.</p>

<p>Govern your children well, for we read that “He who cockers his child
provides for his enemy,” and such a father will soon find the truth of
the Spaniards assertion, viz. “The first service a bad child does his
father is to make him a fool, and the second is to make him mad.”</p>

<p>Give your children good instructions; fear not a little expence, for
“Better unborn than untaught.” And again, “If the brain sows not corn it
plants thistles.” And depend on it, that thistles are prickly things to
parents, when found in the hands of their children. See that you put
good books into their hands; they are apt to get bad ones, and we read,
that “An ill book is the work of thieves.” Be careful of what you say,
in presence of your children. They catch words, as easily as examples,
and tell things abroad, which may make your hearts ache, and every one
will believe that, “The child tells nothing but what is heard by the
<ins class = "correction" title = "two words">fire side</ins>.”</p>

<p>The following proverb I do not like, yet I am fearful it is
applicable in some instances, “The son full and tatter’d, the daughter
empty and fine.” The son should not be tatter’d, nor the daughter empty.
Parental distinctions are odious, and a source of bitterness and of
endless contentions in families.</p>

<h4>THE FATAL MISTAKE;<br>
Or, <span class = "smallcaps">the HISTORY of MR. ELLIOT</span>.</h4>

<p class = "center extended">[<span class = "smallest">WRITTEN BY
HIMSELF.</span>]</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">As</span> various
conjectures will, most probably, be formed on my retirement from the
world by those ignorant of the cause, and the particularity of my life
will most likely occasion illiberal and ill-natured observations,
I&nbsp;write the history of my misfortunes, ignorant into whose hands it
may fall. Let who will become possessed of this manuscript, may it warn
them from excess of passion, and especially from that destructive fiend,
jealousy.</p>

<p>Born to the enjoyment of a large estate, my birth promised every
happiness affluence could bestow: at ten years old my parents both died
of a malignant fever: left to the care of a worthy man, I&nbsp;was not
sensible of their loss. Mr. Osburn (for that was the name of my
guardian) felt for me, as he has often acknowledged, the fondness of
parental love. No event worth relating happened till I arrived at the
age of fourteen, when a young nobleman came to Winchester, where I was
placed; he was the only son of the Earl of Somerset. Distinguished by
his rank, but more so by his merit, his sweetness of disposition
attracted the love of the whole school, and his generosity demanded
their admiration. For some time I was indifferent to all his amiable
qualifications, ’till an accident happened which was the foundation of
the most affectionate friendship. My master was very severe; I&nbsp;had
left school one evening in order to steal apples from a neighbouring
orchard, and had just reached the intended scene of action, when I saw
Lord Edward Marchmont running towards me. As soon as he came within
hearing, he cried out, “My dear Elliot, the doctor has discovered your
absence, and threatens, unless he finds you within bounds, to punish you
with the utmost severity; if you make haste, we may get round a back way
into the play ground, before he comes from hunting over the college, and
escape the old dog’s vigilance.” As I knew the doctor’s disposition,
I&nbsp;complied with my friend’s proposal, and accordingly we gained the
play ground just as our master appeared. Lord Edward pulled a volume of
Homer out of his pocket, on which we were both looking when the doctor
came softly behind us. Upon seeing our employment he was agreeably
surprised, and applauded us for our conduct in terms of the greatest
encouragement. This good natured action so effectually engaged my
gratitude, that I was miserable if separated from him. We grew so fond
of each other, that the whole school took notice of it; our affection
increased with our years, and when the time came to leave school, both
Lord Edward and myself begged we might be at the same university. Lord
Somerset and Mr. Osburn consenting, we were again happy in the society
of each other.</p>

<p>When we had been at Oxford about two years, Lord Somerset paid the
debt of nature, and as my friend was now possessed of the title and
fortune of his ancestors, he left Oxford, and entreated me to do the
same. As the university had lost all its pleasures when my friend
departed,
<span class = "pagenum">277b</span>
I wrote my determination to Mr. Osburn of following him; the good man
would fain have persuaded me to stay longer, but I was not to be moved:
I&nbsp;hastened to London, and according to promise flew to the house of
my Edward, who introduced me with the most flattering character to Lady
Somerset and his sister; the latter was the loveliest work of nature;
joined to a form beautifully perfect, she had an engaging sensibility in
her countenance that seldom accompanies beauty. That amiable Almena
received me with the sweetest complacency, as the friend of her brother,
whom she doated on: the mother of Lord Somerset likewise honoured me
with the greatest marks of esteem, and for a length of time,
I&nbsp;enjoyed every delight that perfect friendship could bestow, but,
alas! I&nbsp;was soon fated to feel a reverse of fortune. My kind and
indulgent guardian was taken suddenly ill; he sent for me, and I was
obliged to leave Lord Somerset and his amiable family: the necessity of
this absence discovered a secret I was willing to hide from myself: it
was not the separation from my friend alone, that caused my grief,
I&nbsp;found I loved his charming sister; the beautiful Almena haunted
my imagination continually: my Edward’s penetration soon discovered the
ill hid partiality, and one day taking me into his study, he addressed
me as follows: “I&nbsp;am infinitely concerned at the cause of our
separation, but I hope we shall soon meet again, by Mr. Osburn’s health
being established; why do you appear so very wretched? Ah Frederick! you
have not been ingenuous with me; why did you doubt my friendship? Have I
ever given you cause to suspect my entire attachment to you? How then
could you violate our regard by a doubtful concealment? Your secret had
rested within this faithful breast had you desired it.” I&nbsp;would
have spoke, but my feelings were too violent for expression. “Compose
yourself,” continued he, “I&nbsp;will explain this painful silence; you
love my sister; your eyes have fully exposed the feelings of your heart,
and I am happy to think our friendship may be closely united by the tye
of relations.” This unexpected eclaircissement elated me beyond idea;
I&nbsp;eagerly embraced my amiable friend, and acknowledged the truth of
his observations; “But, alas! Edward,” continued I, “shall I ever dare
avow my love to your charming sister? What can the exalted Lady Almena
Marchmont see in the poor Frederick Elliot? Will she not despise me for
my presumption, and disdain a man who has nothing but a heart filled
with her perfections to offer?” “And as great a share of merit,”
interrupted my <ins class = "correction"
title = ", missing">friend,</ins> “as ever fell to the lot of one mortal; fear not,
Elliot, my sister has too much understanding to regard a man merely
because he has a title, and in every other qualification you may pretend
to a princess: Almena indeed has a mind capable of distinguishing your
exalted virtues, and if I mistake not feels their full force.” “Flatter
me not, my friend; I&nbsp;cannot <ins class = "correction" title =
"printed without punctuation at line-end">dare not</ins> indulge the
pleasing hope.” My noble Edward promised to do every good office in my
absence, and I took leave of a family where my chief happiness was
centered.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page278" id = "page278">278</a></span>
<p>I reached the habitation of Mr. Osburn just time enough to take a
last farewell; the violence of his disorder had left him very weak, and
death made quick approaches to the excellent heart of this worthy man.
I&nbsp;drew near his bed with the tenderest emotions, and taking his
cold hand between mine; “My dearest sir, how painfully does this sight
affect your Frederick! Ah that I could remove every pang far from you!”
I&nbsp;could not restrain my tears: he faintly pressed my hand, and in a
voice hardly articulate, he delivered himself as follows: “It pains me,
my dear boy, to be obliged to part with you; but it is the decree of
heaven, and I submit. I&nbsp;leave you, Frederick, in the possession of
a large estate that was your father’s; to which I have added my own:
I&nbsp;have no relations who stand in need of wealth, and to none can I
give it whom I love like you. Remember it is virtue alone, that renders
riches valuable. When you come to this solemn period, to which you must,
may no bad action discompose your dying moments; you have an excellent
heart and are in no danger of deviating from the narrow road of
rectitude, but from the violence of your passions. Be careful to avoid
every thing that may lead you into mistake and error. Farewel, my
excellent boy; remember the last injunctions of a man who had a real
affection for you.”</p>

<p>Articulation was stopped, and I could only express my sorrow by sighs
and tears. The clergyman of the parish now came to Mr. Osburn, and I was
obliged to leave him. He soon retired, and informed me that his friend
was on the verge of eternity. When I entered Mr. Osburn’s chamber,
I&nbsp;found him speechless; however by his motions he convinced me he
was sensible. I&nbsp;embraced him in the greatest agony of grief; but,
alas! he could not return it; he looked at me with expressive marks of
affection, and gently breathed his last in my arms. I&nbsp;was for a few
hours so totally absorbed in sorrow, that I hardly knew whether I myself
existed; but youth and the appearance of my Edward, who, on hearing of
my loss, flew to console me, had its usual influence, and I again
recalled my thoughts from the grave of my guardian, to the world and
society.</p>

<p>When I opened Mr. Osburn’s will, I found he had bequeathed to me the
whole of his estate, which amounted to more than two thousand per annum,
which joined to my paternal inheritance, made me possessed of eight
thousand a year. My gratitude was infinitely excited by his generosity;
and except a legacy of five hundred pounds to Mr. Harper, the clergyman
I have mentioned, there was no other bequest. I&nbsp;paid the money
immediately, and added a thousand pounds, as his family were large.
Having settled my affairs, I&nbsp;left the abode of my late guardian,
and accompanied Lord Somerset to town. The fair Almena and her amiable
mother, received me with the utmost kindness, every thing in the power
of these dear friends to dissipate my melancholy was exerted, and though
I felt all the gratitude such a conduct excited yet could I not banish
from my remembrance the good Mr. Osburn.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">278b</span>
<p>I was roused from my lethargy by Lady Almena’s having a declared
lover. Lord Ashford was a nobleman of reputed worth, and I believe truly
attached to my friend’s sister. Lady Somerset seemed to approve the
proposed alliance; my Edward was silent, and Almena appeared unhappy.
Thus were we situated when I was determined to lay aside every fearful
apprehension, and declare my latent flame. I&nbsp;had soon after an
opportunity of revealing the state of my heart to the fair cause of my
anxiety. Lady Almena was one day writing in her brother’s study when I
entered thinking he was there: she blushed and started; but seeing me
about to retire, “Mr. Elliot,” said she, “my brother is from home, but
as I have finished the note I was writing. I&nbsp;beg you will remain
here ’till Lord Somerset comes back.” I&nbsp;again entered the room, and
seated myself by her. She rung for a servant, to whom she delivered the
note, and was going to retire, when I took her hand, and intreated her
to hear me. She did not know in what manner to proceed. I&nbsp;threw
myself at her feet, and in the most respectful terms, declared how much
I loved her. She listened with polite attention, and casting her eyes
upon the ground, appeared greatly agitated. I&nbsp;was all painful
suspense. “Speak, lady Almena, continued I, pronounce my fate; perhaps
you despise my too presumptuous passion; perhaps your heart is already
engaged; the merits of Lord Ashford have met your approbation, and I am
wretched.” “Sorry should I be,” replied the dear charmer, “if the sister
of Lord Somerset could willingly make wretched the friend on whom an
only brother doats: no, Mr. Elliot, I&nbsp;despise affectation as much
as I do coquetry; be assured, sir, Lord Ashford is perfectly indifferent
to my heart: ’tis true, my mother espouses his cause, and pleads for him
powerfully: but the happiness of her daughter has ever been her chief
delight, nor will she insist on a circumstance that would render her
miserable.” “Ten thousand thanks, adorable Lady Almena, for this
condescension! Pardon my bold aspiring heart: may I not hope my
unwearied assiduities may at last make an impression on your gentle
nature in my favour?” She told me, she did not, neither should she wish
to throw me into despair, but begged leave to retire.</p>

<p>My friend soon after appeared, and seeing the joy that animated my
countenance, congratulated me in the most affectionate manner. “Ah,
Edward! exclaimed I, the dear Almena has not driven me to despair: she
does not love Lord Ashford, and I may yet be happy.”&mdash;“And who ever
thought she did? Prythee, Frederick, do not encourage that horrid
passion, jealousy, but rather crush it in its birth; no mortal but
yourself would have imagined my sister had the least regard for Lord
Ashford. You may command my interest in your favour with my mother: she
is partial to his lordship, on account of a tender regard she
entertained for his mother; but the happiness of Almena is a matter of
too great importance to be trifled with; and that no man but you could
make her happy, I&nbsp;have long discovered.”</p>

<p>Under our forms of governments, we may have an opportunity to rival
the celebrated schools of Greece. Republics are the peculiar soil of
liberty, of genius, of talents; for in them, merit is not exclusively
attributed to wealth and birth. How important then, to excite the
generous emulation of talents. What mean more effectual, than to
encourage literary enterprises, stamped with genius and industry.</p>

beverage, and a fat sirloin to a flimsy sonnet, will deprecate it with
the Vandal, and strangle in the cradle every future Homer, Virgil, Livy,

<h4 class = "five">ARTFUL SENTIMENTAL-LOVER.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> man versed in
the wiles of deceit puts on the mask of plausibility and virtue, and, by
these means, disarms the object of his attention and apparent love of
the usual administration of her prudence, lays her apprehensions asleep,
and involves her in misery: misery the more inevitable, because
unsuspected. For she who apprehends no danger, will not think it
necessary to be always upon her guard; but will rather invite than avoid
the ruin which comes under so specious and so fair a form.</p>

<p>One of these sentimental lovers will not scruple very seriously to
assure a credulous girl, that her unparalelled merit entitles her to the
adoration of the whole world; and that the universal homage of mankind
is nothing more than the unavoidable tribute extorted by her charms.</p>

<p>But she should reflect, that he who endeavours to intoxicate her with
adulation, intends one day most effectually to humble her. For artful
man has always a secret design to pay himself in future for any present
sacrifice. If he has address and conduct, and the object of his pursuit
much vanity, and some sensibility, he seldom fails of success; for so
powerful will be his ascendency over her mind, that she will soon adopt
his notions and opinions.</p>

<p>The lover, deeply versed in all the obliquities of fraud, and skilled
to wind himself into every avenue of the heart which indiscretion has
left unguarded, soon discovers on which side it is most accessible. He
avails himself of this weakness by addressing her in a language exactly
consonant to her own ideas. He attacks her with her own weapons, and
opposes, if a sentimental girl, rhapsody to sentiment. He professes so
sovereign a contempt for the paltry concerns of money, that she thinks
it her duty to reward him for so generous a renunciation. Every plea he
artfully advances of his own unworthiness, is considered by her as a
fresh demand, that her gratitude must answer. And she makes it a point
of honour to sacrifice to him that fortune which he is too noble to
regard.</p>

<p>These professions of humility are the common artifices of the vain,
and these protestations of generosity the refuge of the rapacious.</p>

<h4 class = "five">EFFECTS OF HONOURABLE LOVE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A man</span> of delicacy
oft betrays his passion by his too great anxiety to conceal it;
especially if he has little hopes of success. True love, in all its
stages, seeks concealment, and never expects success. It renders a man
not only respectful, but timid, to the highest degree, in his behaviour
to the woman he loves.</p>

<p>To conceal the awe he stands in of her, he may sometimes affect
pleasantry, but it fits awkwardly on him; and he quickly relapses into
seriousness, if not dullness. He magnifies all her real perfections in
his imagination, and is either blind to her failings, or converts them
into beauties. Like a person conscious of guilt, he is jealous that
every eye observes him: and to avoid this he shuns all the little
observances of common gallantry.</p>

<p>His heart and his character will be improved in every respect by his
attachment. His manners will become more gentle, and his conversation
more agreeable; but diffidence and embarrassment will always make him
appear to disadvantage in the company of his mistress. If the
fascination continues long, it will depress his spirit, and extinguish
every vigorous and manly principle of his mind.</p>

<h4 class = "five">LOVE OF JUSTICE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A sense</span> of justice
should be the foundation of all our social qualities. In our most early
intercourse with the world, and even in our most youthful amusements, no
unfairness should be found. That sacred rule of doing all things to
others, according as we wish they would do unto us, should be engraven
on our minds. For this end, we should impress ourselves with a deep
sense of the original, and natural equality of men.</p>

<p>Whatever advantage of birth or fortune we possess, we ought never to
display them with an ostentatious superiority. We should leave the
subordinations of rank to regulate the intercourse of more advanced
years. In youth it becomes us to act among our companions, as man with
man. We should remember how unknown to us are the vicissitudes of the
world; and how often they, on whom ignorant and contemptuous young men
once looked down with scorn, have risen to be their superiors in future
years.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“My</span> father took up
the piece, levelling it at him with a trembling and fearful hand.
‘I&nbsp;beg you will not spare me, and insist upon your aiming at my
head or heart!’ The Marquis look his aim, but trembled so violently that
he was obliged to lay down the gun. Alumbrado desired me to step nearer,
and putting my hand to his bare breast, said: ‘Feel whether this heart
beats so timmorously as that of your father.’ These words provoked the
pride of the Marquis, he ordered me to step aside, levelled his piece
and discharged it. A&nbsp;cloud of smoak concealed Alumbrado’s situation
for a moment from our eyes. It is impossible to depict the sensations
that rushed upon my heart, when I beheld him in his former situation,
and heard him exclaim: ‘You have aimed well, my Lord, however, the ball
has recoiled from my breast, there it lies on the floor.’ My father sunk
on his knees and lifted his hands to heaven as if praying, and I gazed
at Alumbrado with silent awe.</p>

<p>“<ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">‘Duke!’</ins>
said the latter, ‘charge the gun once more.’ The marquis started up,
exclaiming: ‘For what purpose?’ ‘I&nbsp;want your son to repeat the
deed.’ ‘No, there is no occasion for it;’ my father replied, <ins class=
"correction" title = "text has double for single quote">‘the</ins>
omnipotence of the Eternal has been glorified sufficiently.’ ‘Just now,’
Alumbrado returned, ‘you have been of too little faith, and now you are
too credulous? Is it impossible that you should have missed your aim?
That the ball accidentally has hit another object and recoiled? But
although you should be convinced that you have aimed well and hit me, is
the Duke so too?’</p>

<p>“In short, I was obliged to charge the piece again, and Alumbrado
exposed his uncovered bosom once more.</p>

<p>“I could rely on my gun, and was sure not to miss him, because he was
standing only seven paces from me. I&nbsp;pointed at Alumbrado’s head,
took my aim well, and fired; however, he stepped forth from the cloud of
smoak like a being of a superior order; the ball lay on the floor, and
Alumbrado had not received the least hurt.</p>

<p>“He now took a dagger out of his pocket, and plunged it twice in his
breast, up to the hilt, extracting it without a wound being seen.</p>

<p>“O my friend, make haste to recant at the feet of this astonishing
man the prejudices which you have uttered against him. Blush at your
philosophy, whereby you have combated so frequently my propensity to
supernatural events. I&nbsp;have always had a presentiment that this
irresistible propensity would be gratified one time; yet I was a
stranger to the road which led to the object of my most ardent wishes.
Alumbrado has pointed it out to me and a new epocha of my life has
commenced with that period. How little, and how disgusting and vain does
now all the wisdom and all the tinsel splendor of the world appear to
me, since I have been made acquainted
<span class = "pagenum">282b</span>
with that higher good, which is concealed from, and inaccessible to the
greatest part of human kind.”</p>

<p>“P.S. On reading my letter over, I find a few passages in it, which
would determine me not to send it on account of the great watchfulness
with which all letters are examined by order of the King, if I had not
been assured that those which are directed to you are exempted from
examination<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>Having perused this letter of the Duke of Ca*ina, I did not know
whether I should hasten first to him, to his father, or to Alumbrado.
I&nbsp;ordered instantly my carriage to be got ready; but when I was
going to step out of the house, my valet stopped me pale and panting for
breath. ‘My Lord,’ he stammered, ‘Coming&mdash;&mdash;I
have’&mdash;&mdash;‘Well, what is the matter?’&mdash;&mdash;‘It is
almost incredible,’ he resumed, ‘it is rumoured all over the town<ins
class = "correction" title = "text has ,">’.&nbsp;</ins>Here he stopped
again. His consternation communicated itself to me, and I exclaimed in a
trembling accent, ‘For heaven’s sake! what has happened?’ ‘It is
reported that the Marquis of Villa R*al and his son<span class =
"locked">---</span>but don’t be terrified, my Lord!’ ‘What?’
I&nbsp;replied, ‘Are you,’ I&nbsp;could not proceed, my lips being
sealed with terror, ‘It is rumoured that the Duke of Ca*ina and his
father have been taken up on an accusation of having conspired against
the life of the King.’</p>

<p>These words curdled the blood in my veins, and I was ready to drop to
the ground; however, despair soon roused me from the stupor that had
seized me. I&nbsp;got in my carriage in order to enquire personally into
the truth of that dreadful intelligence. Coming in the street I observed
a universal commotion, and received, but too soon, a&nbsp;confirmation
of my valet’s intelligence; being informed, at the same time, that forty
five persons more had been arrested along with the Duke and his father.
The multitude were assembled before the royal palace, demanding with a
furious clamour, that the traitors should be delivered up to them; the
king however thanked them for their zeal, and ordered the constable to
disperse the populace.</p>

<p>My astonishment, my agony and consternation, and an indisposition
which had been brought on by the violent agitation of my mind, prevented
me from recollecting that this was the very day on which I was to expect
the friend, of whose intended visit I had been apprised by that letter
from an unknown person. The succeeding day I happened to see that letter
accidentally on my writing-desk, and the friend to whom I was to deliver
it, not having made his appearance at the fixed hour, I&nbsp;made use of
the liberty I had received to open&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Conceive my astonishment when I saw the handwriting of the Duke of
Ca*ina. “When you shall read these lines,” he wrote, “the great deed
will be performed, and <span class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;l</span>
reduced again under the <span class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;sh</span>
dominion. Forgive me, for having this time deceived your confidence, and
believe me, that nothing but your connection with the new King could
have prevented me from communicating the matter to you before our design
is carried into execution. For that reason only I have had recourse to
art, and wrote this letter which will inform
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page283" id = "page283">283</a></span>
you of the whole transaction, but is to be opened only when it will be
impossible to put a stop to our undertaking.</p>

<p>“Not only my father and myself, but also those two prelates whom I
have mentioned in my letters, and a great number of noblemen agreed
after several conversations to force the usurper to restore the crown of
<span class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;l</span> to the King of <span
class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;n</span>; yet this design appeared to be
so dangerous, that neither the Marquis nor myself would engage in it
before we had the consent of Alumbrado. We pressed him, therefore, one
evening to grant us his permission and assistance. He hesitated a long
while, and at length replied, ‘Well! I&nbsp;will oppose you no longer,
but I declare solemnly that I will not afford you the least assistance
in your design against the King before I shall be convinced that it is
the will of God, which we can learn by no other means but prayer. The
spirit of God inspires those that are praying to him with sincerity of
heart, and the sentiments which prevail in our soul in that situation
are the voice of God. Let us devote this night to prayer, address the
Omniscient separately, and to-morrow morning communicate to each other
what the Lord shall reveal to us. If you shall continue firm in your
resolution after you have performed your devotion, then it is the will
of the Eternal, and we will go to work.’</p>

<p>“I had, for a long time, entertained the wish of spending a night in
a church, imagining that this would afford me a pleasure of a most
singular nature. I&nbsp;resolved, therefore, to execute Alumbrado’s
proposal, and, at the same time, to gratify this darling wish of my
heart. With that view, I&nbsp;concealed myself one evening in the
cathedral. The first idea which forced itself upon my mind, as soon as I
was left alone in that sacred place, was that of the immediate presence
of the Eternal, and this notion filled me with solemn awe.</p>

<p>“I went to the altar, throwing myself on my face upon the steps of it
and adoring the omnipresent God with ardent fervour. I&nbsp;soared
beyond the limits of materiality, transported by devotion, and my soul
and every sense was hurried along by the torrent of holy enthusiasm.
I&nbsp;prayed with filial submission for filial illumination and
heavenly aid.</p>

<p>“The clock on the church steeple tolled eleven, when I recovered from
my pious trance. The church was covered with awful darkness; the
solitary lamps which were burning before the altar, and the images of
the saints, produced on the opposite parts of the fabric large masses of
light and shade, while they spread only a faint dusk over the other
parts of the Gothic building. The presence of the Eternal, the
melancholy stillness of night, the extensive circumference of the
venerable edifice, made me sensible, with a kind of horror, of my
solitary situation. The profound stillness that reigned around was
interrupted only now and then by a momentaneous cracking by the
clattering of the windows, the whistling of a gust of wind rustling
through the softly resounding organ-pipes, and by the chiming of a
bell.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">283b</span>
<p>“Proceeding further, I was struck with the hollow sound of my
footsteps, which reminded me that the marble pavement covered the vault
in which the bodies of the deceased fathers of the order were awaiting
the morn of resurrection.</p>

<p>“I went through one of the aisles, and stopped in awful
contemplation, now at an altar, now at the image of a saint, and now at
a tomb. The antique, artless appearance of many images and <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘statutes’">statues</ins> contributed
much to increase their awful effect. A&nbsp;chapel, where a whole length
picture of Christ on the cross was suspended attracted my attention
particularly, because the quickly repeated flirtation of the lamp which
was placed before it had made me fancy that the picture was stirring.
The singular distribution of light, darkness, and shade prevailing
through the whole church, the sudden flaring and dying away of the
lamps, produced the most different and surprising effects on the eye,
and furnished the imagination with multivarious objects of
occupation.</p>

<p>“At length, I entered a great hall, which led to the hindmost porch,
and from thence to a church-yard, the iron gate of which was locked. The
first look I directed at it made me start back, seized with surprise.
I&nbsp;looked once more at it, and beheld again several white figures
that appeared and vanished with a rustling noise. I&nbsp;cannot but
confess that a chilly tremor seized my limbs and fixed me to the ground.
A&nbsp;few minutes after, a&nbsp;monk carrying a lanthorn appeared in
the back part of the burying place; and a short reflection unfolded to
me the whole mystery. The noise which I had heard proceeded from his
steps, and the figures were nothing else but white <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘statutes’">statues</ins>, which appeared
and disappeared as he moved the lanthorn in walking. Probably he had
been praying in the porch, and was now returning to his cell:
I&nbsp;concealed myself in a pew, in order to avoid being seen by him.
A&nbsp;weariness which proceeded from the chilly night air and a want of
sleep, bade me, at length put a stop to my wanderings. I&nbsp;seated
myself in a pew, where I abandoned myself to the wild freaks of my
imagination.</p>

<p>“The dawn of day was already peeping through the stained windows,
when I awoke from the fanciful dreams of my wondering mind, and the
purple rays of the morning sun reflected with radient glory from the
image of the holy Virgin, suspended against the wall opposite the
window. I&nbsp;was absorbed in the contemplation of this sublime object
for some time; however the trance in which this charming sight had
thrown me, soon gave room to religious sensations of a more sublime
nature; a&nbsp;pious confidence in the heavenly aid of Providence was
kindling in my bosom, and I was going to prostrate myself before the
blessed Virgin, when the church was thrown open<ins class = "correction"

(Continued from our last)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I expressed</span> my
obligations to his friendship in the warmest and most grateful terms,
and we consulted how the matter should be broke to Lady Somerset; my
friend undertook the task.</p>

<p>That very evening, as his sister was engaged out, and I had
determined to be absent, I&nbsp;waited in a state of the most anxious
expectation for the event of his embassy; and on seeing him enter my
room at one o’clock in the morning, I&nbsp;had hardly resolution to
inquire his success. “My friend, my brother,” exclaimed he, “I&nbsp;am
authorised to call you so by the most amiable of mothers, Almena is
your’s, win her, my dear Frederick, and be happy.”</p>

<p>Words were too faint to express my feelings; my Edward shared my
emotions, and for a time we lost the remembrance of every thing but
friendship. Now each adverse cloud appeared removed, and happiness
permanent and delightful dawned on my morning joys. Lady Somerset
informed lord Ashford, that her daughter’s heart was engaged: his
disappointment betrayed him into the most violent rage, and he left the
house threatening to be revenged.</p>

<p>Blessed as I was in Almena’s love, and in the friendship of her
amiable brother, I&nbsp;disregarded his threats, and smiled at the
apprehensions of my charmer: three weeks after this made me her happy
husband; my friend gave away his lovely sister, and shared in our
felicity. My wife was every thing that was excellent and good; her love
for me was unbounded, and mine was to such a painful excess, that I
could not bear a look cast at any other person. To this unhappy jealousy
of temper all my subsequent misfortunes were owing.</p>

<p>For twelve months, we enjoyed the most perfect felicity, when Lady
Somerset appeared to be declining in her health. Her physicians advised
her to go to the south of France: my Almena was desirous of accompanying
her beloved parent, but her situation rendered it improper and
dangerous. Lord Somerset was determined to attend her, which greatly
alleviated my wife’s uneasiness. As London did not agree with lady
Almena, and as the season was far advanced, I&nbsp;proposed going to
Trout-Hall, for the ensuing hot months: she consented chearfully, as her
lying-in was not expected for a considerable time. The separation of my
beloved from her mother and brother may be better imagined than
described. We immediately went into the country, where I exerted the
most unwearied assiduity to amuse and divert her thoughts from dwelling
too much on the late melancholy parting. On a visit to a neighbouring
family I was amazed to see lord Ashford. He addressed my wife as if
nothing had passed between them, and me with the most polite freedom.
Some few weeks after, I&nbsp;had been out a little way, and on my
return, asked the servant if any body had been there
<span class = "pagenum">284b</span>
during my absence? “Lord Ashford, Sir, has been an hour with my lady.”
I&nbsp;hurried to my wife’s apartment, and opening the door gently,
surprized her in tears. “How is this, my love? what has happened to make
you uneasy?” “Nothing particular, replied she, I&nbsp;was thinking of my
poor mother, you must pity the weakness of your wife, my Frederick.”
<ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“My</ins> Almena,
my dearest love, answered I, clasping her to my bosom, I&nbsp;cannot
bear your tears; talk not of weakness, you are all that is amiable and
lovely.” She seemed soothed with these words and appeared more chearful;
as she did not mention lord Ashford’s having been there, I&nbsp;did not
choose to start the subject.</p>

<p>We passed a month in the most perfect tranquility, having heard in
that time from my friend, who gave us a pleasing account of lady
Somersets health. My Almena’s happiness was excessive at this
information, and joy beamed on her lovely countenance; I&nbsp;frequently
left her at her own desire, to partake of country amusements, though my
inclination would have ever detained me with her; yet to make her easy I
complied. She feared a too constant attendance on her would weaken my
affection, and make me uneasy at so great a restraint.</p>

<p>One day, I had stayed longer than usual in hunting, and was hastening
to meet my wife, when I perceived lord Ashford riding up the avenue:
these visits and always in my absence greatly alarmed me. He would have
avoided me, but I rode up to him, and after a slight civility, begged to
know what had occasioned the honour of my seeing him there? He looked
confounded, and making an evasive answer spurred his horse, and rode
away with great precipitation. This conduct, so very enigmatical,
enraged me infinitely; I&nbsp;was inclined to pursue him, and force him
to confess what his business was, but a moment’s thought deterred me
from such a conduct. I&nbsp;entered the house, torn by a thousand
emotions, and went to my wife, who fled with open arms to receive me.
I&nbsp;brutishly turned from her. “Lady Almena, has Lord Ashford been
here?” I&nbsp;looked at her very sternly, she hesitated and blushed;
“No, my dear; but wherefore this unkindness! Alas, Mr. Elliot, have I
offended you?” She burst into tears. Oh, how I cursed my own horrid
disposition! I&nbsp;strove to abate her grief by every method in my
power: and had she at that moment informed me of her conjectures, what a
weight of woe had been spared to my succeeding days! But my misery was
not to be avoided. I&nbsp;applied to the servant, who had before
informed me lord Ashford had been at my house, who confirmed my
suspicions by telling me, my hated rival, as I then madly thought him,
had been a considerable time with his lady. I&nbsp;was too much affected
by this news to answer the servant; and leaving him in the greatest
haste, I&nbsp;determined to return to my wife and tax her with her
inconstancy; but the consideration of my Almena’s situation deterred me;
as she was drawing near her time I reflected I might be her
destroyer.</p>

<h4><span class = "super">CURIOSITY</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Of</span> the various
passions that are natural to mankind, Curiosity seems to be one of the
most active and powerful; which, unless it be engaged in laudable
pursuits, and confined within the limits prescribed by Virtue, often
becomes a disease pernicious and fatal to the mind, and exhibits human
nature in a most pitiable point of view.</p>

<p>Nothing can be conceived more contemptible, and at the same time move
dangerous, than a merely enquisitive person: “he is generally a blab,”
says the poet; “and ought to be avoided, as we would the spy of an
enemy.” Such a one may be compared to the Danaide’s tub, which was
incapable of containing what it received: for, whatever comes under his
inspection, or is mentioned in his hearing, he is sure to publish; and,
when opportunity shall serve, will enlarge and illustrate.</p>

<p>This excessive prying and communicative disposition, has been
observed to be particularly prevalent in those who are naturally
indolent, and have no useful employment to divert their imagination. The
mind, if it be not engaged in the pursuit of useful knowledge, must
necessarily be active in the investigation <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘of’">of of</ins> trifles, and matters of small
moment. Thus, for instance, the indolent man, who affects to be
studious, as he is deterred from the attempt to acquire solid learning,
by that care and assiduity which are the consequent attendants on
laborious study; so he squanders that time, which might be employed to
better purposes, in the search after trifles. He contents himself with
the knowledge of things, that can contribute nothing to his learning;
nor could his ignorance of them diminish aught from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>But there is a kind of Curiosity, which produces more fatal effects;
and which argues, that the disposition of those who are actuated by it,
is not only indolent as to commendable enquiries, but that they are also
envious and malicious, and enjoy great satisfaction in exposing to
public censure the faults and failings of every one around them. We meet
with beings of this description, in every place, without exception, who
make it their business to pry into the affairs of others. It is a kind
of trade with them, wherein one deals more largely than another; and he
is esteemed the greatest who can dispose of most scandal. Such persons
are finely described in the fable of the Lamiæ; who, we read, were blind
at home, but when abroad were remarkably quick-sighted. In like manner,
these Curiosi are fully blinded as to their own demerits; while not only
the more open and flagrant faults of others, but even the smallest
inadvertensy, or mistake, is subject to their strict enquiry and nicest
examination. Being always more solicitous to enquire into the failings
of their neighbours, than to notice and imitate their good qualities;
and hurried on by the strong <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘impuse’">impulse</ins> of this restless passion, they spare no pains in
searching to the very bottom of a thing that is but whispered, and enjoy
no peace till it becomes public and universally known.</p>

<p>I well remember, when a worthy and respectable family first went to
reside at a place that contained a numerous class of these idlers, what
a stir it caused among them!
<span class = "pagenum">285b</span>
Running about from one place to another, various suppositions, and
exclamations of surprise, passed between them. “I&nbsp;wonder who this
new-come family are!” says one; “and whether they are people of much
property?” “No great deal, I&nbsp;should conceive,” replies another;
“for they keep a very poor house, and are fashionable in no respect
whatever.”&mdash;“Aye,” says a third, “I&nbsp;hear that they go to
market, not with ready-money, but on trust.”&mdash;“I am informed,” says
a frigid old maid, with a contemptuous sneer, “that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
and his wife, live unhappily together, on account of a familiarity that
subsists between him and the chambermaid.”&mdash;“Pray, can any one
inform me,” says a formal old widow, “whether they observe any
regularity in their family? What is their hour of dining? Do they keep
late hours? And what is their time of rising?”<span class =
"locked">---</span>“O!” says one of the male gossips, “they are very
particular, Madam, I&nbsp;can assure you in regard to those things, and
do every thing by rule; and they are the most penurious and miserable
wretches on earth, for they always keep the key of the cellar.” Thus,
these triflers, to call them no worse, amuse themselves with groundless
conjectures, and unjust censure, the absurdity of which needs no
remark.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding every transaction, that comes under their
cognizance, is handed about with the worst construction it is capable of
receiving, they by no means stop here. Not content with the information
themselves are able to collect, they have their private emissaries to
communicate intelligence, and give them notice of the domestic affairs
of every family in the town, which become the subject of debate the next
time they assemble; for they have their meetings, where the conversation
never fails to be such as wounds the honour and reputation of some of
their neighbours. If any one in company presumes to speak of another
with praise and commendation, he is either attended to with careless
indifference, or totally disregarded; and considered as one who wishes
to violate the laws and rules of the society. On the contrary, should he
call in question the chastity of some sage matron, or relate the
misfortunes of some frail female; should he make the discord of
families, or the animosities of friends, the topick of conversation;
they are all attention, and listen to the scandalous report with the
highest degree of satisfaction.</p>

<p>One grand incentive to Curiosity, is a fickle and unsteady temper,
with a fondness for novelty. When, therefore, the mind in any of it’s
sallies borders on frivolity, it ought immediately to be checked, and
have its attention directed to some other object less unworthy the
consideration of a rational creature. Thus, by bringing this passion
under the government of Reason, at the first, we may prevent the unhappy
consequences that envy and spleen might otherwise spur it on to
effect.</p>

<p>In diseases of the body, by not attending to the first symptoms of a
disorder, and stopping it in the beginning, it often happens, that it
gains strength through delay; and, in process of time, bids defiance to
the powers of medicine. Thus it is with diseases of the mind. Such, and
so inveterate is the nature of vice, that unless it be eradicated on its
first appearance, and destroyed in its
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page286" id = "page286">286</a></span>
infancy, the contagion soon extends it’s baneful influence over all the
faculties of the mind, and enervates the whole intellectual system.</p>

<p>In order to the preservation of health, on the slightest attack of
any corporal malady, it is expedient to have immediate recourse to those
means which are considered the best adapted to impede it’s progress: and
if, to remove infirmities of the body, so much precaution be necessary,
surely the mind demands still greater attention. But how frequently do
we find this nobler part of man, either very little regarded, or totally
neglected! Too often are the innate virtues of the soul extinguished by
the insinuations of Vice! its nobler powers enfeebled by the alluring
wiles of that fascinating enchantress; and rendered useless, as to the
end and design for which they were originally intended; or, what is
worse, applied in promoting the advancement of her cause, to our own
perpetual disgrace!</p>

<h4><span class = "extended">CURIOUS INCIDENT</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">It</span> was formerly

their sons, who had taken the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘prætexa’">prætexta</ins>. When something of superior importance was
discussed in the senate, and the farther consideration adjourned to the
day following, it was resolved that no one should divulge the subject of
their debates till it should be formally decreed. The mother of the
young Papirus, who had accompanied his father to the Senate-house,
enquired of her son what the senators had been doing. The youth replied,
that he had been enjoined silence, and was not at liberty to say. The
woman became more anxious to know: the secretness of the thing, and the
silence of the youth did but inflame her curiosity; she, therefore,
urged him with the more vehement earnestness. The young man, on the
importunity of his mother, determined on a humorous and pleasant
fallacy: he said it was discussed in the senate which would be most
beneficial to the state, for one man to have two wives, or one woman to
have two husbands. As soon as she heard this, she was much agitated;
and, leaving her house in great trepidation, hastened to tell the other
matrons what she had learned. The next day, a&nbsp;troop of matrons went
to the Senate house; and, with tears and entreaties, implored that one
woman might be suffered to have two husbands, rather than one man to
have two wives. The senators, on entering the house, were astonished,
and wondered what this intemperate proceeding of the women and their
petition could mean. The young Papirus, advancing to the midst of the
senate, explained the importunity of his mother, his answer, and the
matter as it was. The senate, delighted with the honour and ingenuity of
the youth, decreed that, from that time, no youth should be suffered to
enter the senate with his father, this Papirus alone <ins class =

the cognomen of Prætextatus, on account of his discretion at such an
age.</p>

<h4>LIFE OF BONNA, THE SHEPERDESS.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Bonna</span> was the
daughter of a shepherd of the Valteline, a fruitful valley at the foot
of the Alps, and the grand pass between Italy and Germany. As she was
one day guarding her flocks, Peter Brunoro, an illustrious Parmesan
general, lost his way near the spot where she attended her innocent
companions. Brunoro politely accosted the rural maid, to enquire the
road, but was so struck with her beauty, and so pleased with her
courteous answer, that he dismounted and entered into conversation with
the sheperdess. Bonna was no prude, and she had wit enough to
distinguish a gentleman from a rustic; in short, her vivacity, and a
certain air of modest assurance, admirably calculated to hit the taste
of an officer, had such an effect upon him, that he fell in love with
her, and carried her off. From this time, we are to consider her not as
the Arcadian sheperdess, but as Brunoro’s mistress.</p>

<p>Finding that she had a bold, masculine spirit, he took great pleasure
in dressing her in men’s cloaths; and he had the satisfaction to
observe, that she was ambitious to gain a masculine address! Brunoro
soon learned her to manage the fleetest courser, and as he was
remarkably fond of hunting, she was always of his party, and acquitted
herself to the astonishment of all the cavaliers.</p>

<p>A quarrel happening some time after between Francis Sforza, duke of
Milan, and Alphonsus, king of Naples; Brunoro quitted the service of the
king his master, and went over to the duke of Milan’s party: Bonna, his
faithful mistress accompanied him, and signalized herself in the first
campaign. The difference between the contending parties being
accommodated by the interposition of mediators, Brunoro was received
again into the service of Alphonsus, and Bonna was presented to the king
as a young Amazon: her talents for war and politics became every day
more and more conspicuous; and upon a rupture between the Venetian
republic and the duke of Milan, she had the address to negociate at
Venice, the command of the Venetian army, with an appointment of 20000
ducates per annum during the war for Brunoro. The general’s heart, at
this striking piece of felial affection in his mistress, was now touched
with a lively sense of honour for Bonna, he regretted he had ever took
advantage of the assenting and unguarded Shepherdess, and, to repair
past injuries, and in gratitude for such signal services, married his
benefactress: After this event, she placed no bounds either to her
conjugal affection, or her love of arms. She accompanied her husband
wherever he went: and while the general was engaged upon some other
service, she headed a detachment, and took the Castle of Pavanou, near
Brescia, from the Milanese, by assault.</p>

<p>The senate of Venice honoured her with distinguished rewards, and
placing an unlimited confidence in both husband and wife, sent them to
the succour of Negropontus, attacked by the Turks. They defended this
island so ably, that during the time that they commanded, the Turks
desisted from all further attempts on the place. Bonna died on her
return to Venice at a small town of Morea, leaving behind her two
children, and an immortal reputation.</p>

<h4>THE FLOWER-GIRL.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">&mdash;“Pray</span>, buy a
nosegay of a poor orphan!” said a female voice, in a plaintive and
melodious tone, as I was passing the corner of the Hay-market.
I&nbsp;turned hastily, and beheld a girl of about fourteen; whose
drapery, tho’ ragged, was clean, and whose form was such as a painter
might have chosen for a youthful Venus. Her neck, without covering, was
white as snow; and her features, though not regularly beautiful, were
interesting, and set off by a transparent complexion: her eyes, dark and
intelligent, were shaded by loose ringlets of a raven black, and poured
their sweetly supplicating beams through the silken shade of very long
lashes. On one arm hung a basket full of roses, and the other was
stretched out towards me with one of the rose-buds. I&nbsp;put my hand
into my pocket, and drew out some silver<span class =
"locked">---</span>“Take this, my pretty girl,” said I, putting it into
her’s; “and may that God, who is the Father of the fatherless, be the
preserver of your existence and your virtue!<span class =
"locked">---</span>Virtuous poverty is no crime.”</p>

<p>I was turning from her, when she suddenly caught my withdrawn hand;
and, putting it to her lips, burst into a flood of tears. The action,
and the look which accompanied it, touched my soul; it melted to the
artless gratitude of this poor Flower-girl, and a drop of sympathy fell
from my cheek. “Forgive me, Sir,” said she, recovering from her
transport, while a sweet blush diffused itself over her lovely face: “my
heart was full of what it could not express<span class =
"locked">---</span>nature impelled me to so free an action. You will
pardon the effect it had on me, when I tell you, they were the first
kind words I have heard since I lost all that was dear to me on
earth&mdash;&mdash;” A&nbsp;sob interrupted her discourse: she stopped,
and wept silently; then, raising up her face from the hand on which she
had laid it<span class = "locked">---</span>“O Sir! I&nbsp;have no
father! no mother! no relation! Alas! I&nbsp;have no friend in the

could proceed<span class = "locked">---</span>“My only friend is God! on
him I rely; I&nbsp;submit to his will. I&nbsp;only pray that I may

protect you!” added she, dropping a curtsey full of humility and native
grace, as she retired. I&nbsp;returned her benediction, and
went&nbsp;on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“And can I thus leave this poor creature?” said I, as I walked
pensively on. “Can I leave her forever, without emotion? What have I
done for her, that can entitle me to her prayers? Preserved her a few
days from death, but that is all! And shall I quit thee, fair flower, to
see thee no more? to be blown down by the rude blast of adversity! to be
cropped by some cruel spoiler! to droop thy lovely head beneath the
blight of early sorrow!&mdash;No! thou hast been reared on some happier
bank; thou hast been nurtured by the sweet tears of maternal affection;
thou hast once blushed beneath the chearing sun of domestick content,
and under it thou shalt bloom again!” I&nbsp;turned, as I spoke: my
heart beat with its sweet purpose.

<h4><span class = "super">GRATITUDE</span>.</h4>

<p class = "center smaller">
“If aught gives one virtuous man a superiority over another,<br>
it is only by as much as he exceeds the other in Gratitude.”</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Gratitude</span>, though a
single word, contains a volume of expressions: it is the brightest jewel
in Virtue’s diadem. It comprehends every social duty, and every
celestial virtue, that adorn mankind; it renders them objects of
Almighty love, and worthy the admiration of their fellow-creatures.
Divested of Gratitude, what are we? Nought but solitary reeds, blown by
every breeze, and beat down by every shower, that God, in the plenitude
of his mercy, sends to chear the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Gratitude may be said to consist of two orders&mdash;to God, and to
man.</p>

<p>Gratitude to God is indisputably our first and chief duty. Can we for
a moment contemplate the creation of the world, the coming, sufferings,
crucifixion, death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, without
acknowledging that Gratitude to God is our first and chief duty? God
forbid! There are few, in this world’s sphere, but daily, nay even
hourly, experience the goodness of the Almighty. How are we extricated
from difficulties? How are we relieved, even when desponding misery
rankles in the heart? And how do we enjoy our health, or happiness, but
from the excess of that mercy which gently drops from Heaven? Can, then,
our lives be better spent than in devoting them to those purposes
esteemed worthy in God’s all-seeing eye, and expressive of our gratitude
for the blessings we receive?</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“Never let day or night unhallow’d pass,</p>
<p>But still remember what the Lord has done.”</p>

<p class = "right smallcaps">Shakespeare.</p>
</div>

<p>Of Gratitude to man, much has been, and much still remains to be
said. It may be urged that, in our Gratitude to God, every kind of
gratitude is contained. This may be granted; and, therefore, to Him
should we give the glory. If we are really grateful, we shew it not only
to Him, but to those whom he makes the instruments of his goodness.</p>

<p>From the earliest period, we find that centre of every virtue,
Gratitude! honoured, revered, and even adored.
<span class = "pagenum">289b</span>
How many have sacrificed their lives in gratitude for services received
from others; and, dying, blessed the cause in which they died! Gratitude
to man consists in a grateful remembrance of every favour, however
trifling or essential. It is to be hoped that a man, plunged by
misfortune into dire distress, confined within the narrow and dreary
cell of a prison, surrounded by an infant family, some senseless of the
misery they endure, sleeping on a bed of straw, a&nbsp;helpless babe in
his arms, pining for it’s mother, who is gone, alas! in vain, to soothe
the obdurate heart of a relentless creditor<span class =
"locked">---</span>it is to be hoped, I&nbsp;repeat, that human nature
does not produce such a man, who, were he relieved from this horrid
situation, by the benevolent hand of smiling Affluence, would ever cease
to remember, without the softest emotions of extatic pleasure, the truly
generous act: if he could, he should cease to live.</p>

<p>Other instances, equally forcible, might be brought forward; but man
who ought not to forget the smallest obligation, or neglect the
slightest opportunity of manifesting his gratitude. It matters not,
whether our gratitude be called forth into action by pecuniary
assistance in the hour of distress, solace in the hour of misfortune, or
help in the moment of personal danger. He who relieves another in a
pecuniary manner, he who sighs with him in his misfortunes, or he who
saves the life of another, is equally entitled to our prayers, our
praise, and our gratitude.</p>

<h4>PLEASURES OF STUDY.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">There</span> is unspeakable
pleasure attending the life of a voluntary student. The first time I
read an excellent book, it is to me just as if I had gained a new
friend. When I read over a book I have perused before, it resembles the
meeting with an old one. We ought to lay hold of every incident in life
for improvement, the trifling as well as the important. It is not one
diamond alone which gives lustre to another; a&nbsp;common coarse stone
is also employed for that purpose. Thus I ought to draw advantage from
the insults and contempt I meet with from a worthless fellow.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I hastened</span> to
conceal myself in a corner, and slipped out of the church as soon as the
sexton had entered it. In going home, I&nbsp;fancied I observed
Hiermanfor at a distance, nay he seemed even to advance towards me;
however, I&nbsp;fled from him with horror.</p>

<p>“About an hour after my return, I was joined by Alumbrado, who
entered my apartment with awful solemnity. His countenance spoke more
plainly than his lips. We went to the Marquis who seemed to have awaited
our arrival with impatience, and bowed respectfully to Alumbrado.</p>

<p>“You have been watching last night,’ the latter said to us, ‘and
dedicated it to devotion. Is your resolution still firm and
unalterable?’</p>

<p>“Yes!’ we replied at the same time.</p>

<p>“A long pause ensued. At length Alumbrado began: ‘I too have
dedicated the night to devotion, and join in your league.’ Taking us by
the hand, ‘I&nbsp;have conversed with God, and received heavenly
revelations, which I will communicate to you if you will promise eternal
secrecy.’</p>

<p>“We promised it.</p>

<p>“Yes, my friends,’ he resumed, ‘God has chosen you to be ministers of
his avenging justice. Your mission is honourable, but awful&mdash;awful,
and at the same time, blissful. But I must remind you, that it does not
befit the instruments of the Eternal to scan his holy <ins class =
"correction" title = "text unchanged: error for decrees">degrees</ins>,
nor to resist. Will you, therefore, promise to obey implicitly?’</p>

<p>“We will.’</p>

<p>“To obey also when the decrees of God shall come in contradiction
with your opinions and feelings?’</p>

<p>“The decrees of the Eternal are impenetrable, but ever wise and ever
just. We will obey!’</p>

<p>“Then you swear to obey blindly?’</p>

<p>“We swore, and now we learned from Alumbrado our mission, and the
whole plan of the secret league. It would be superfluous to give you the
particulars of it, because it will be executed, and consequently known
to you when you shall read this letter.&mdash;Farewell, my friend, for
whom I always shall retain a tender affection, although you should
become my inveterate enemy. Farewell.”</p>

<p>This letter partly unfolded to me the mystery of the whole event;
I&nbsp;could, however, best form a clear idea of the particulars of the
conspiracy and the whole design when the culprits were tried.
I&nbsp;shall confine myself to a brief sketch of that infernal plot.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘Oli*ariz’">Oli*arez</ins> the Minister of S&mdash;&mdash;n, not having
been able to put a stop to the secret preparations the Duke of <span
class = "locked">B&mdash;&mdash;za</span> had been making for restoring
the crown of Port&mdash;l to his family, and his three last artful
attempts to that effect having miscarried, he sent Alumbrado whom he had
<span class = "pagenum">290b</span>
already successfully employed on different occasions, to watch the
secret motions of that nobleman, and to counteract them effectually.
Alumbrado fixed his eyes on a man who was generally respected as well on
account of his rank, his birth, and extraordinary merits, as of his
great wealth; the Marquis of Villa Re*al, whose secret antipathy against
the Duke of <span class = "locked">B&mdash;&mdash;a</span>, Oli*arez had
pointed out to him. With the assistance of this man, he designed to lay
the mine which was to blow up the great work of the Duke of <span class
= "locked">B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;a</span>. He found the Marquis
in a situation of mind that seemed to promise very little success in the
prosecution of his political views.</p>

<p>The supposed apparition of Count San*, and the illness which had
succeeded it, had changed him from a statesman to a pietistical hermit.
However, an intriguing genius like Alumbrado was not discouraged by
these unfavourable symptoms; he only changed his measures, and founded
on religious fanaticism and superstition a plan, by which he expected to
interest the Marquis for his designs. Yet he had, perhaps, imagined this
task much easier than it really was, or the progresses the Marquis made
were slower than he had expected, in short, the revolution broke out
before he had attained his purpose. This unexpected blow did not depress
Alumbrado’s spirit. He had, indeed, not been able to dispute the
acquisition of the crown of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l</span> with the Duke of <span class =
"locked">B&mdash;&mdash;a</span>; he formed however, the resolution to
deprive him of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>With this view he returned to S&mdash;&mdash;n to consult with
Oli*arez. The latter had really been induced by the dissimulation of the
Duke of Cam*na, to believe him serious in his devices against the family
of <span class = "locked">B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;a</span>, and
this was sufficient to prompt him to agree with Alumbrado that one ought
to endeavour to interest the Marquis and his son for the design against
the new Sovereign.</p>

<p>That, and how this has been effected, was proved afterwards by the
event.</p>

<p>Alumbrado had foreseen that the execution of so dangerous a design
would require many co-operating powers, and therefore had taken care to
procure in time the requisite assistants. One of his principal
associates was the archbishop of Br*ga, Primate of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l</span>, an acquisition which
cost Alumbrado very little trouble, the Prelate meeting him half way.
The archbishop had witnessed the successful issue of the revolution with
the greatest indignation, because he was entirely devoted to the S<span
class = "locked">---</span>sh court and the Vice Queen to whom he owed
his preferment.</p>

<p>On the breaking out of the Revolution, he had already drawn the sword
against one of the conspirators in order to avenge his benefactress; her
confinement was therefore an additional motive to him for joining the
conspirators, by whose assistance he hoped to avenge her wrongs and
restore her to liberty. Alumbrado gained through him even the bishop of
*arda, Grand Inquisitor of the Empire.</p>

<p>The insinuation that he would not enjoy long his important office
under the new government, the King being
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page291" id = "page291">291</a></span>
inclined to abolish the Inquisition, was the chief motive of his having
taken a part in the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Both prelates were very sensible how necessary it was that the
Marquis and his son should join the conspirators if Alumbrado’s design
should succeed, and therefore supported him in his endeavours to ensnare
these noblemen, although they dissembled to have not the least
connection with that vile deceiver.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the latter endeavoured secretly to encrease the number of
the conspirators through the interest of these two prelates, and they
succeeded in gaining over to their party Count Arm*mar a cousin to the
Primate, a&nbsp;great number of other Port**ese noblemen and the Jews.
It has already been mentioned in the letters of the Duke, that the new
King rejected their petition of being suffered to live and to trade in
the kingdom as external Christians, uncontrolled by the Inquisition. The
Primate made them a voluntary offer of that privilege; nay, he even
promised secretly, in the name of the King of S<span class =
"locked">---</span>n, that they should have a public synagogue, if they
would co-operate in the execution of the plot, which they consented to
without hesitation.</p>

<p>The design itself was, indeed, horrid enough. On the 6th of August,
1641, the Jews were to cause a conflagration in the night, not only in
the royal palace, but also in different parts of the town, in order to
divert the attention of the people. Then the conspirators were to
penetrate into the palace under the pretext of extinguishing the fire,
and to stab the King; the Queen, however, and the two young Princes,
were to be seized by the Duke of Ca*ina, in order to obtain through them
the possession of the castle. The Primate with his train was, meanwhile,
to parade through the streets, in order to frighten the refractory
multitude with the Inquisition, and when the whole plan should have been
happily executed, the Marquis of Villa R*al was to be invested with the
dignity of Vicegerent.</p>

<p>This was the plan of an undertaking that could be attempted only by
fool-hardy and deluded men. Alumbrado, who knew best how hazardous and
adventurous it was, was well aware, that, even if their design should be
executed in the most successful manner, the capital only would be
gained, and every thing lost again if they were not supported by an
external power. He found it therefore necessary that a S<span class =
"locked">---</span>sh fleet should be ready to surprise the port as soon
as the fire should break out, and a small army of S-&nbsp;-&nbsp;-rds
waiting on the frontiers, in order to penetrate in the country on the
first intelligence of the successful execution of the undertaking.
Oliv*rez was to afford this assistance, and consequently, intelligence
must be sent him and every thing preconcerted, which was extremely
difficult, the new Sovereign, having issued the strictest orders not to
suffer any suspicious letter <ins class = "correction"
title = "missing ‘to’ supplied from Dublin and London editions">to</ins> pass the
frontiers.</p>

<p>Ba*za, of whom I have already made mention in a former page, had, on
account of his extensive trade, received an exclusive privilege of
carrying on an unmolested correspondence with S<span class =
"locked">---</span>n.</p>

<p>Alumbrado found means to insinuate himself with
<span class = "pagenum">291b</span>
his important man in such a manner, that he undertook the dangerous task
of forwarding the letter which contained that intelligence. However<span
class = "locked">---</span></p>

<p>The Irishman was returned from his journey. Some expressions which he
accidentally overheard and several unusual movements his eagle eye
espied, excited his suspicion, in spite of the secrecy of the
conspirators and the great precaution they observed in carrying on their
plot. He found it, nevertheless, very difficult to come upon the right
tack. Although he had succeeded in his attempt of getting admittance to
Ba*za’s house in the disguise of a foreign merchant, and gained the
confidence of that man by means of some very great money transactions,
yet he could not trace out the least thing concerning the secret plot
which he suspected to be carrying on, Ba*za being always on his guard,
notwithstanding the repeated invectives the Irishman uttered against the
new government in order to allure him to take the bait. But when Ba*za
received the aforesaid letter in order to send it to S<span class =
"locked">---</span>n, he betrayed so much anxiety that it could not
escape the keen-sighted looks of the Irishman. The latter employed every
art to dispose the merchant to direct that letter to the Marquis of
Aja*onti, a&nbsp;commander of a Spanish fortress on the frontier, and
acted his part with so much dexterity, that Ba*za adopted his advice
without entertaining the least suspicion, thinking that the letter would
certainly be delivered to the Minister when it once had reached the
Sp&mdash;sh territory.</p>

<p>The Irishman could not indeed, divine the important contents of the
letter, and the uneasiness which the merchant betrayed concerning its
safe delivery, could also have originated from the great importance of
the mercantile papers it might have contained. It was, therefore,
a&nbsp;mere act of prudence that he sent instantly a message to his
friend Ajam*nti, requesting him to examine that letter carefully if it
should come to his hands.</p>

<p>The Marquis receiving the letter opened the first cover, and seeing
it directed to the Sp&mdash;sh Minister of State, and sealed with the
great seal of the Primate of P<span class = "locked">-----</span>l, his
suspicion having been roused by the previous notice he had received from
the Irishman, he opened it without hesitation, and thus discovered the
imminent danger threatening the life of the King of <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;l</span>.</p>

<p>Being a near relation to the Queen and sincerely attached to the
King, he sent the letter without delay to his royal kinsman. The King
was seized with astonishment and horror when he learned what a dreadful
plot was carrying on against himself and the kingdom.</p>

<p>He convoked instantly the Privy Council, and concerted with them the
necessary means which were to be taken in order to <ins class =

<h4>REASONS<br>
<span class = "smallest">WHY MEN OF GENIUS SELDOM RISE ACCORDING TO
THEIR MERIT.</span></h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Amid</span> the illusions
deceiving mankind, which Hope sighs for, or Pleasure grasps at, none are
more fallacious than the dreams of success, which Fancy imprints, from
the consciousness of her deserts, on the tablet of imagination. When an
author boldly pursues the path of fame, when he strikes out into the
mazes of intricate disquisition; however his Genius, prompted by her own
powers, might at first promise success, yet from circumstances unknown,
he too often fails in his attempt: like the bold adventurer who,
searching for the diamond in the bowels of the mine, fell a victim to
the blasting vapour of contagion and death.</p>

<p>No one will deny, that merit ought to have it’s reward; and, that
every encouragement should be given for advancement in the moral or
intellectual world. Habits of virtue would then be acquired from
necessity; and ambition, in greatness or goodness, meet with universal
admiration and applause: but, before human nature can arrive at such a
state of primitive excellence, some of the bad passions must be expelled
with rankle in the human heart. A&nbsp;barrier must be raised between
envy and admiration; and ingratitude banished, as the pest of moral and
intellectual happiness. I&nbsp;might farther analyse, and draw a
parallel between the powers of the mind and it’s passions, to shew, that
what prompts the one to goodness, stimulates the other to greatness; but
it would be unnecessary to mention arguments, or canvass hypotheses,
which have already been made the subject of frequent discussion.
I&nbsp;shall, therefore, confine myself to the reasons why Genius too
often sinks into obscurity, even while her breast expands with
benevolence<span class = "locked">---</span>while virtue and greatness
animate her heart.</p>

<p>Ambition, while restrained within certain bounds, is highly
commendable; when exceeding those limits, it degenerates, and becomes
vicious. I&nbsp;shall, therefore, first point out this delicate barrier,
perceptible only by the unprejudiced; to be trodden on by those alone
who are innately good, and can bid each “passion move at the command of
Virtue.” It is necessary that there should be some incitement to noble
actions, to rouze the mind from torpidity, and promote the exertion of
her powers. This incentive to greatness is called Ambition; and is
equally fought for by the workman who excels in mechanism, the general
who leads an army, and the statesman who commands the applause of
senates. By a fascinating power, it beguiles mankind; and has but one
predominant fault<span class = "locked">---</span>an unbounded satiety.
This gigantic precipice, which hides her head amid the clouds, is only
to be climbed by the man of genius; and, when he mounts towards the
summit, if he can view the prospect around him without a swimming head,
and a dizzy eye, he is truly noble.</p>

<p>In our various gradations through life, if we can view and admire the
summit of excellence which we have not reached, or look down with
pleasure on that which we
<span class = "pagenum">292b</span>
have passed, while we enjoy the plaudits of a surrounding world, each of
us shall feel the secret praise of our own heart, proud in the
consciousness of it’s integrity. Ambition, then, is the guide of Genius;
it either raises it to perfection, or hurls it, in an unguarded moment,
into obscurity. While, therefore, we can admire abilities greater, or
perhaps less than our own, this laudable incentive will elevate and
ennoble us; if, on the contrary, we despise or envy these powers, it
will soon sink us into shame, and our works into oblivion.</p>

<p>I have made this digression, because a certain kind of
ambition&mdash;for there are many species belonging to the genus<span
class = "locked">---</span>is the most essential cause why men of
letters do not rise so well as they have reason to promise themselves,
or even as they deserve.</p>

<p>Modesty is the inseparable attendant on Merit; at least, a certain
kind of diffidence is felt by every man of genius, which too often
hinders him from intruding himself on public notice. Possessing a mind
fraught with the dignity of it’s own powers, he scorns those trammels
with which an unfeeling world would too often gall his tender neck, and
fetter down his lofty spirit. When, therefore, he explores the depths of
science, or with unbounded good-nature skims the surface, for the
benefit of mankind; he exults in the hope of that success which he had a
right to demand, and looks forward to the promised harvest of the
well-earned field. Though he may thus snatch his images, in daring
enthusiasm: and, with “a&nbsp;phrenzy-rolling eye,” survey the expanse
of nature; yet seldom will a harsh world comprehend<span class =
"locked">---</span>or, comprehending, reward<span class =
"locked">---</span>a dignity of mind, which might do honour to a class
of beings higher than ourselves in the scale of existence. Every man who
labours for the community, even should he fail, ought to be thanked for
the pains he has taken; as every attempt to enforce the practice of
those qualities which adorn and dignify the human heart, must
necessarily merit applause.</p>

<p>There is certainly one excuse alledged by mankind in general, why
they do not reward Genius according to it’s merit; and the reason,
I&nbsp;will add, cannot fail, if persisted in, to tear the laurel from
the brow of infant worth, and trample it in the dust. They assert, in
fact; that authors are the enemies of each other, and will not allow
their reciprocal fame to live.</p>

<p>To lay the metaphor aside; men of letters are too seldom men of
generosity. It is a harsh expression, and I must beg pardon of the world
for using it; but still cannot retract, till they disprove my assertion.
Instead of cherishing a young author, or admiring a refined and superior
genius; the wits of the age, in the one instance crush, and in the other
snarl at and depreciate, his merits.</p>

<p>In a word, if authors would be more generous to each other’s
productions<span class = "locked">---</span>for perfection is not the
attribute of humanity<span class = "locked">---</span>if they would
pardon the defects, and at the same time extol the beauties they read,
merit would no longer linger in obscurity; the embryo fire of genius
would again soon burst on the world, fostered in the bosom of Virtue,
and fanned by the breath of Fame!</p>

<p class = "center smaller">
(Concluded from our last)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">However</span> I was
resolved to observe her conduct as well as lord Ashford’s and act
accordingly. I&nbsp;therefore assumed an air of tranquility, and, by my
tenderness, seemed to have banished every painful sensation from her
bosom; when one day as we were talking on family matters, and wondering
we had not heard from lord or lady Somerset for two months past,
a&nbsp;servant brought me a letter from an intimate friend who was
dying, and begged to see me; I&nbsp;would not have complied with his
request, disagreeable as it was to refuse, had not my Almena insisted on
my going.</p>

<p>In a fatal hour I complied with her entreaties, and left her with the
utmost reluctance. When I came to the house of Mr. Warner, I&nbsp;found
he had expired two hours before my arrival; I&nbsp;paid a tribute of
tears to the memory of honest George, who had been my college familiar;
and as I had no further business, I&nbsp;hastened back to my wife.
I&nbsp;entered the house unobserved by any one, having delivered my
horse to a servant I met in the yard, and was proceeding to Lady
Almena’s dressing room, with all the anxiety of love, when, on hearing
the sound of voices I stopped, and clearly distinguished my wife, who
pronounced these words: “You cannot imagine what I have suffered in this
cruel separation. My heart has felt every painful sensation, you have
been exposed to: believe me, my lord, my love for you is as violent as
before my marriage.” “My love, my dearest Almena, answered a manly
voice, I&nbsp;do believe you, and am convinced nothing can abate your
affection for me.” I&nbsp;heard no more, but rushing to my apartment I
seized my sword, and determined to end my woe, by plunging the weapon
deep in the heart of the villain who had dishonoured me, I&nbsp;burst
open the door of the dressing room, and, heart-rending sight! beheld my
wife locked up in the arms of Lord Ashford, as I imagined.</p>

<p>Transported by my rage, I sprung towards him, and buried my sword in
his body! He groaned and fell! But, oh Heavens! what were my feelings
when I beheld the face of Lord Somerset! Though it was almost dark,
I&nbsp;plainly perceived the features of my friend as he lay extended on
the floor, bathed in his blood. My Almena had fainted on seeing her
brother fall, and so stupified was I with horror at the rash action I
had committed, that I was incapable of giving the least assistance to
either.</p>

<p>My faculties at length forsook me, and I fell senseless; the noise of
my fall brought the servants crouding to the apartment, there to behold
the most horrible sight that ever shocked the eyes of humanity! When I
recovered to a sense of my misery, I&nbsp;found my wife had been carried
to her apartment during her fit, and Lord Somerset was seated in an
armed chair.</p>

<p>Some of the servants were gone for a surgeon, whilst others were
endeavouring to stop the effusion of blood.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">293b</span>
<p>He faintly opened his eyes, and casting them on me with a look of
infinite sweetness, addressed me in the following manner, in a voice
hardly audible: “Whatever, my dear Frederick, was your motive for a
conduct so precipitate and rash, be assured I heartily forgive you; and
am certain, mistake and fatal misapprehension were the cause of my
death!” Here he stopped. The horror and distraction of my thoughts were
so great, that, had not my servants prevented, I&nbsp;should have
plunged the fatal sword in my own breast! By force they wrested it from
me; and I was doomed to bear a wretched existence! I&nbsp;threw myself
at the feet of Lord Somerset, and entreated his pardon.</p>

<p>My agonies were so great that before I could inform him of the truth,
I&nbsp;was again deprived of my senses. I&nbsp;remember no more, than
that after having been a long time confined to my chamber,
I&nbsp;recovered to endless remorse!</p>

<p>The excess of my grief threw me into a violent fever which continued
a month; during which time my wife and lord Somerset breathed their
last! The latter lived only three days after the fatal wound he had
received from me. He had a paper drawn up in which he solemnly attested
my innocence, and acquitted me of his death. I&nbsp;found he had been
acquainted with my jealousy of lord Ashford, by the villain who was
hired by that scandal to nobility; the servant who had informed me of
his lordship’s visit’s to my wife, was the detested creature of this
wretch; and these falsities had been invented merely to disturb our
domestic harmony; to which the appearance of his comrade in iniquity the
day I had been hunting <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘and’">had</ins> greatly added, joined also to his evasive conduct.
These particulars lord Somerset had been informed of by a letter from
the abandoned fellow, who had left the kingdom, as his vile employer
soon after did. But though my grief on the death of my Edward was little
short of madness, yet the fate of my unhappy wife, rent my
heart-strings! that angelic sufferer, on recovering from her fainting,
immediately fell into strong labour; and after continuing in the utmost
agony for a whole day and night, expired with her unhappy infant ere she
had given it birth.</p>

<p>She left her forgiveness for him who had destroyed her and her
brother. I&nbsp;am unable to describe the melancholy situation in which
I was involved.</p>

<p>Several times I was tempted to end my miserable being; but some
remains of conscience being left, I&nbsp;dared not rush into the
presence of my Maker, uncalled for. I&nbsp;was greatly assisted in my
resolution of enduring life, by the worthy Mr. Harpur, <!-- clergyman
who attended his guardian --> who on hearing of my melancholy situation,
left his family and came to my house.</p>

<p>The world by his prudent management remained uninformed of my
misfortunes; supposing my wife died of a fever in her lying-in, and Lord
Somerset of an apoplectic fit. I&nbsp;wrote to lady Somerset the
melancholy account of my folly and rashness, and intreated her pardon,
as she valued the peace of my soul. But alas! she lived not to grant it
me: her sorrow for the loss of her children, joined to her ill state of
health soon brought her to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page294" id = "page294">294</a></span>
the grave! Thus had the violence of my passions destroyed three persons
dearer to me than the whole world. Mr. Harpur would have persuaded me to
leave Trout-Hall, as the scene of my wretchedness, only aided the
poignancy of my sufferings, but all his arguments were vain: I&nbsp;was
resolved to dedicate my life to penitence on that mournful spot.
I&nbsp;accordingly built a retreat in the park and never after left it
except once a year, when I forsook my humble habitation, to spend a few
hours in the house where my greatest misery was compleated.
I&nbsp;generally distributed a large sum of money to the poor
inhabitants of the neighbourhood on that day, and in the evening
returned to my cottage. I&nbsp;hope my sincere repentance and sorrow for
my crimes may have atoned for them to that power whose blessings I had
so infinitely abused. For twenty years I lived uninterrupted by any
mortal save the good Mr. Harpur, who sometimes came and spent half an
hour at my solitary residence. Here I lived and enjoyed more content
than I ever thought could have fallen to my lot, after the miseries of
my former life. As my prayers for mercy and pardon, at the throne of
Heaven, have been real and sincere, so I trust I shall be forgiven, and
whenever it shall please the deity to call me hence, I&nbsp;shall
rejoice to obey his summons, hoping I shall have peace in a better
world, and my error totally obliterated.</p>

<p>One thing I should have mentioned, which is, that the twenty-fifth
year of my retirement, I&nbsp;made Mr. Harpur a present of thirty
thousand pounds, and left my estate to a distant branch of my family,
the only surviving relations I had. I&nbsp;begged my worthy friend to
have my remains deposited in a tomb that should be erected in my
convent, as I was used to call my residence. This, I&nbsp;have no doubt
he will see performed, and may the melancholy incidents of my life warn
them who shall see this manuscript, against the blameable use of reason.
Had I suffered mine to have had its proper influence, I&nbsp;had not
been plunged in such uncommon distress.</p>

<h4 class = "super">NEGLIGENCE</h4>

<p class = "center smallest">IN EPISTOLARY CORRESPONDENCE.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I have</span> no patience
with those who apologize for not writing letters to their friends or
acquaintances, by saying they have not time enough. Few people are so
much pressed for time, as not to be able to spare half an hour, or an
hour, in any day, for a particular avocation; a&nbsp;space quite
sufficient for writing a letter. Most of those who make this silly
excuse, are frequently, during the day, at a loss for filling more time
than would suffice for this purpose. The true reason of the neglect
seems, therefore, to be want of inclination rather than of leisure; and
he who says&mdash;“I have not time for writing,” might in general say,
with more honesty&mdash;“I am too indolent.”</p>

<p>But here it may be alledged, in favour of this neglect of
correspondence, that it is not worth while, merely for the sake of
amusement, to write letters; that it is irksome
<span class = "pagenum">294b</span>
to sit down and be obliged to compose an epistle without possessing any
subject of real and necessary business; and that the efforts of
invention give to this employment the fastidious nature of a task. These
objections, strictly taken, are undeniable: but it is most evident, that
whoever makes them, must bind himself never to engage in any
correspondence, or write a single letter that is not absolutely and
indispensably necessary. And if this principle, which flows from the
objections, be allowed, then epistolary correspondence must be left
entirely to the concerns of business; and the communications of
separated friendship, of love, and all other degrees of social
affection, are at an end.</p>

<p>Many people sit down to write a letter as to perform a displeasing
imposition, which they anticipate with reluctance, and defer as long as
they can with decency. I&nbsp;have no objection to that reluctance,
provided they would at first<span class = "locked">---</span>whether
requested to correspond, or spontaneously offering<span class =
"locked">---</span>ingenuously confess, that they consider all
correspondence, which is not absolutely necessary, to be unworthy of
regard: for by this explicit declaration of their sentiments, they would
at once rid themselves, and others, of all trouble and expectation on
the subject. <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for That?">The</ins> people should acquiesce in preserving
correspondence, and then attempt to justify the neglect of it, by
reasons which should have been offered before it was entered into, is
the matter of complaint.</p>

<p>To such as consider that correspondence by letter is but another sort
of personal communication, it will appear strange, that to compose an
epistle, should be esteemed by those who possess any of the social
affections, as a labour and hardship. Every person, it may be supposed,
has some intimacy or acquaintance which he would wish to preserve, and
if so small a portion of time might be made subservient to that
agreeable purpose, is it not astonishing that so much reluctance should
accompany the performance? The most indolent scruple not to confess
their absent connections in terms of affection or attachment, but yet
cannot induce themselves to accomplish that frequent interchange of
sentiment, which constitutes the essence of friendship, and the nature
of correspondence.</p>

<p>It should seem that those who acknowledge the existence of their
absent attachments, but are yet too supine to preserve regular
correspondence with them, are either under the dominion of an habitual
and inveterate indolence, or else they do not feel the power of those
attachments so strongly as they would have us imagine. For will the
person who feels a real and undeniable pleasure in correspondence,
excuse himself from it by such frivolous objections? Will the
affectionate wife, separated from her faithful husband; will the ardent
lover, debarred from the object of his adoration; content themselves for
omitting this delightful duty, by alledging that they have not time? If
the occupation employed ten times the space, they would contrive to
accomplish it. And why is this? Because they take an unfeigned pleasure
in the employment.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page295" id = "page295">295</a></span>
<p>It will not avail to say that the fervour of passion often induces us
to sacrifice more time to one object than is reasonable. It is
sufficient to deduce, from these instances, that what we really delight
in, we can always find means to perform.</p>

<p>Examine employments in which the warmth of passion is by no means
concerned, as many there are which interest not the affections, but
which by various people are highly esteemed; and you will find that such
people contrive, whatever may be their other avocations, to dedicate
sufficient time to those esteemed employments. Every man has a
partiality for some occupation or amusement, in which, important as his
necessary business may be, he can find time to indulge himself. And thus
some persons, indolently inclined, can always contrive to devote a great
portion of their time to their favourite goddess, Idleness; however
loudly the calls of business, and of affection, may strive to detach
them from her influence.</p>

<p>The general falshood, therefore, of this apology for neglect of
correspondence<span class = "locked">---</span>“I have not time,” is
evident; being nevertheless true, with the change of one word for
another, viz. instead of time, say inclination.</p>

<p>I am apt, however, to believe that this aversion to letter-writing is
confirmed, if not induced, by the defect of conversance with literary
composition. Since those who have been disused to writing, are observed
in general to dislike it; and, on the contrary, persons who have had a
learned education, and been early accustomed to epistolary
communication, are least averse to it. The defect of practice in
composition, must undoubtedly occasion a difficulty of collecting the
sentiments, and of properly arranging and expressing them, that may
render the employment truly irksome, notwithstanding the utmost warmth
of affection. But it should be remembered, that little art is necessary
to express the sensations of friendship; and that the simple language of
sincerity is universally preferable to the most laboured compositions of
ingenuity and elegance.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">&mdash;“Are</span> you
satisfied?” cried Edgar, accompanying his words with a dreadful thrust.
The sword entered the breast of Richard, and but just escaped his heart.
“Are you satisfied?” repeated he, while drawing the weapon from the
wound, reaking with the blood of his friend. Richard would have replied,
but his speech failed. He groaned; he gasped for breath; he fainted.</p>

<p>The clashing of swords, and the words of Edgar, arroused the
venerable inhabitant of the forest. He slipped on his garments, and
hastened to the scene of action: With some herbs, of the nature of which
he was acquainted, he staunched the bleeding, and Richard again opened
his eyes. When the hermit saw he was so far recovered, he returned to
his cottage, to prepare a bed, and get other things in readiness for the
reception of the wounded person.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">295b</span>
<p>The first object that Richard’s returning sight brought to view was
Edgar. “Traitor! Villain!” he feebly uttered, “hence from my sight<span
class = "locked">---</span>life is no longer pleasing to me<span class =
"locked">---</span>you have strewed before me bitterness. My sister you
have wronged; in an unguarded moment you took the advantage; you
triumphed over her virtue: And do you still suppose I can behold you
with tranquility? If you do, know that I detest you.”</p>

<p>“For this I will be revenged!” exclaimed the other. “Take that!<span
class = "locked">---</span>and should our spirits meet in other worlds
revenge I’ll still pursue!” Here the wretch, triumphing over a fallen
enemy, plunged his sword deep into the heart of Richard; and
extinguished the spark of life that still remained.</p>

steps<span class = "locked">---</span>“he saw the iron enter his

<h4><span class = "super">ESSAY ON MARRIAGE</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">There</span> is nothing
which renders a woman more despicable than her thinking it essential to
happiness to be married. Besides the gross indelicacy of the sentiment,
it is a false one, as thousands of women have experienced.</p>

<p>But a married state, if entered into from proper motives of esteem
and affection, is the happiest, makes women the most respectable in the
eyes of the world, and the most useful members of society. Care should
be taken not to relinquish the ease, and independence of a single life,
to become the slave of a fool, or a tyrant’s caprice.</p>

<p>Love is very seldom produced at first sight; at least, in that case,
it must have a very unjustifiable foundation. True love is founded on
esteem, in a correspondence of tastes and sentiments, and steals on the
heart imperceptibly. Therefore, before the affections come to be in the
least engaged to any man, women should examine their tempers, their
tastes, and their hearts very severely; and settle in their own minds,
what are the requisites to their happiness in a married state; and, as
it is almost impossible that they should get every thing they wish, they
should come to a steady determination what they are to consider as
essential, and what may be sacrificed.</p>

<p>Should they have hearts disposed by nature for love and friendship,
and possess those feelings which enable them to enter into all the
refinements and delicacies of these attachments, matters should be well
considered before they give them any indulgence.</p>

<p>Should they have the misfortune to have such tempers, and such
sentiments deeply rooted in them; should they have spirit and resolution
to resist the solicitations of vanity, the persecution of friends; and
can they support the prospect of the many inconveniences attending the
state of an old maid, then they may indulge themselves in that kind of
sentimental reading and conversation, which is most correspondent to
their feelings.</p>

<p>But if it is found on a strict self-examination, that marriage is
absolutely essential to their happiness, the secret should be kept
inviolable in their own bosoms; but they should shun, as they would do
the most fatal poison,
<span class = "pagenum">297b</span>
all that species of reading and conversation, which warms the
imagination, which engages and softens the heart, and raises the taste
above the level of common life. If they do otherwise, let them consider
the terrible conflict of passions this may afterwards raise in their
breasts.</p>

<p>If this refinement once takes deep root in their minds, and they do
not mean to obey its dictates, but marry from vulgar and mercenary
views, they may never be able to eradicate it entirely, and then it will
embitter all their married days. Instead of meeting with
sense,&mdash;tenderness&mdash;delicacy&mdash;a lover&mdash;a
friend&mdash;an equal companion in a husband, they may be tried with
insipidity and dulness;&mdash;shocked with indelicacy;&mdash;and
mortified by indifference.</p>

<p>To avoid these complicated evils, joined to others which may arise
from the opinion of the infelicity thence arising; women who are
determined, at all events to marry, should have all their reading and
amusements of such a kind, as do not affect the heart nor the
imagination, except in the way of wit and humour.</p>

<p>Whatever are a woman’s views in marrying, she should take every
possible precaution to prevent being disappointed. If fortune, and the
pleasure it brings be her aims, the principal security she can have for
this will depend on her marrying a good-natured, generous man; who
despises money, and who will let her live where she can best enjoy that
pleasure, that pomp, and parade of life for which she married him.</p>

<p>In order to ensure felicity, it is difficult to point out in the
married state the most effectual method, nor can we advise whom a woman
should marry, but we may with great confidence advise whom she should
not marry.</p>

<p>A companion that may entail any hereditary disease on posterity,
particularly madness, should be avoided. Such risque is the height of
imprudence, and highly criminal.</p>

<p>A woman should not marry a fool; he is the most intractable of all
<ins class = "correction" title = "; missing">animals;</ins> he is led
by his passions and caprices, and is incapable of hearing the voice of
reason. Besides it may probably too hurt a woman’s vanity to have a
husband, for whom she has reason to blush
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page298" id = "page298">298</a></span>
and tremble every time he opens his lips in company.</p>

<p>But she worst circumstance that attends a fool, is his constant
jealousy of his wife’s being thought to govern him. This renders it
impossible to lead him; and he is continually doing absurd and
disagreeable things, for no other reason but to shew he dare do
them.</p>

<p>A rake is always a suspicious husband, because he has only known the
most worthless of the sex.</p>

<p>Women, who have a sense of religion, should not think of husbands who
have none. If husbands have tolerable understandings, though not
actuated by religious principles themselves, they will be glad that
their wives have religion, for their own sakes, and for the sake of
their families.</p>

<p>If they are weak men, they will be continually shocking and teasing
them about their principles.</p>

<p>A sudden sally of passion should never be given way to, and dignified
with the name of love.<span class = "locked">---</span>Genuine love is
not founded on caprice; it is founded in nature, or honourable
views;&mdash;on virtue&mdash;on similarity of tastes, and sympathy of
soul.</p>

<p>In point of fortune, which is necessary to the happiness of both,
a&nbsp;competency is requisite. But what that competency may be, can
only be determined by their own tastes. If they have enough between
them, as will satisfy all demands, it is sufficient.</p>

<p>Marriage will at once dispel the enchantment raised by external
beauty; but the virtues and graces that first warmed the heart, that
reserve, and delicacy which always left the lover something further to
wish, and often made him doubtful of his mistress’s sensibility and
attachment, may and ought ever to remain.</p>

<p>The tumult of passion will naturally subside; but it will be
succeeded by an endearment that affects the heart in a more equal, more
sensible, and more tender manner.</p>

in the night of which the plot was to be carried into execution, the
King sent orders <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘to/to’ at line break">to</ins> all the troops that were quartered in the
neighbourhood of Lis*on, to march instantly to the capital under the
pretext of a review. On the morning of the same day, he delivered
himself sealed instructions to his most faithful officers, ordering them
not to be opened before noon, when they were to execute the contents
with the greatest dispatch.</p>

<p>These precautions being taken, the king ordered the Great Council of
State to assemble at one o’clock. The Bishop of Br*ga and the Marquis of
Villa Re*l were arrested as soon as they entered the council chamber,
and
<span class = "pagenum">298b</span>
a captain of the life guard seized the Duke of Ca*ina at the same time
in the public street. This was the time when all the officers opened
their sealed orders, which contained the names of those whom they were
to arrest, and of the prison to which they were to conduct them. Every
one of the conspirators was confined in a different prison, and some
were arrested by more than one officer. All those that had been ordered
to execute the king’s command, arrived at the same time at the places of
their destination, and performed their mission almost in one moment. The
number of the prisoners amounted to forty-seven.</p>

<p>A committee of Grandees was now appointed to try the conspirators.
The letters through which the plot had been discovered were not produced
of the beginning of the trial, in order not to betray the Marquis of
Aja*onti. Baeza being threatened to be put to the rack confessed first,
and the rest confirmed his confession after having been put to the
torture. The Marquis of Villa Re*l and the Duke of Ca*ina, and the two
prelates confessed voluntarily.</p>

<p>Alumbrado endured the first degree of the torture without confessing
any thing; however, at the second he began to be more tractable.</p>

<p>Imagining that my readers will be desirous to learn the particulars
of the life of this extraordinary man, I&nbsp;will give a short sketch
of what I could learn.</p>

<p>He was born at *a*. If the virtues of parents were as inheritable as
their rank and fortune, he would not have been a disgrace to a family as
noble as it was respectable. Already in his juvenile age he exhibited
marks of a penetrating understanding, of an <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘exraordinary’">extraordinary</ins> docility and
acuteness, but nature had thrown away her gifts upon a villain. The
great rigour with which his father watched his conduct, had no other
effect but that of making him a hypocrite, for he would commit any crime
if he could do it unobserved, although he was generally believed to be a
pattern of every virtue. In his ninth year he killed a girl by a stone
thrown from a sling, and was capable not only of fathering the crime
upon one of his play-fellows, but, at the same time of rendering his
accusation more plausible by his solemn protestations, and the tears he
shed over the corpse. Progress of time changed his conduct not in the
least, he rather improved in wickedness, and in the art of concealing
his crimes.</p>

<p>Inheriting from his father an immense fortune, he determined to
indemnify himself for his former constraint, by the most licentious
manner of life, and abandoned himself to all sorts of debauchery, with a
fury that ruined both his health and his fortune. The grief at this
conduct broke the heart of his mother, at which he was not very sorry,
expecting to improve his fortune by a new inheritance. He was, however,
disappointed, for his mother, thinking it sinful to support him in his
debaucheries, left her wealth to a cloister. Glowing with thirst for
revenge, he set it on fire and ran away.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page299" id = "page299">299</a></span>
<p>The vengeance of Heaven pursued him, and want soon completed the
measure of his wretchedness. Whithersoever he went he was haunted by the
unrelenting punishments of the Omnipresent Judge on high, and the
greatest distress. At length he obtained leave of a captain, who was
just going to sea, to embark on board of his vessel.</p>

<p>Thus he did, indeed, get out of the reach of public justice, but not
of the vengeance of Heaven. The ship was captured by Algerine pirates,
and he was dragged to captivity.</p>

<p>He abjured his religion and turned Mahometan, in order to ease the
yoke of slavery that lay heavy on his shoulders. His great capacities
enabled him soon to improve his situation, and during some successful
cruizes against his own countrymen, he acquired a considerable fortune,
which he increased rapidly through his speculations on land and sea,
which he carried on for more than twenty years with astonishing
success.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he took every opportunity of injuring the Christians, and
Portugal lost through his infernal intrigues her most valuable
possessions in Africa.</p>

<p>Yet his good fortune became at last the source of new misfortunes,
puffing him up with pride in such a manner, that he aspired to a dignity
in the state which a renegado rarely or never obtains. The Dey of
Algiers died, and he spared neither expences nor artifices to be
constituted his successor; his ambitious views were however
frustrated.</p>

<p>His pride was wounded, and he endeavoured to gain his aim by
additional bribes, but in vain! Enraged with new disappointment, he
conspired against the new Dey; a&nbsp;Dervise, whom he wanted to
implicate in his plot, betrayed him, and he had scarcely time to save
himself by a sudden flight, leaving all his ill-gotten wealth
behind.</p>

<p>On his return to Europe he disguised himself in the garb of a
pilgrim, and affected to be a peregrinating penitentiary. Wherever he
passed through he pretended to have visited the holy sepulchre, where
the infidels had detained him a long while, in captivity, from which he
had been delivered, at length, in a miraculous manner. He distributed
small pieces of wood, stone and earth, as valuable relics, for which the
poor superstitious multitude paid him great sums of money.</p>

<p>Thus he roamed from place to place, and met every where with
credulous people, with hospitality and alms. At Aran*uez he got
acquainted with the Bishop of <span class = "locked">P&mdash;</span>*,
who, at that time, exercised the office of a papal legate at the court
of Spa*n. His pharisaical hypocrisy enabled him to ingratiate himself
with that worthy prelate, who was so much deceived by him, that he
received him into his service.</p>

<p>Alumbrado dispatched the private secretary of his deluded master by a
dose of poison, and succeeded him in his place. The unsuspecting prelate
was so much pleased with Alumbrado’s abilities and services, that he
recommended him to Oliva*ez when he returned to Rome.</p>

<p>The character of the Prime Minister of Spa*n differed
<span class = "pagenum">299b</span>
materially from that of the Bishop; Alumbrado, however, knew how to
accommodate himself to every one. He soon prejudiced his new patron so
much in his favour, that he entrusted him with the execution of a
political charge of the greatest importance, and Alumbrado acquitted
himself so well of his commission, that the Minister promised to reward
his services on the first opportunity. Alumbrado improved every
opportunity of securing the favour of his master, and endeavoured
anxiously to explore his ruling passions.</p>

<p>The keen-sighted dissembler soon found out that the Minister was a
great admirer of the occult sciences, and instantly hinted that he had
acquired a great knowledge of those sciences on his travels. From that
moment the Minister was rather in Alumbrado’s service than the latter in
his.</p>

<p>Thus they had lived together in mutual good understanding five years,
when the commotions in Portu*al began to alarm the Court of Mad**d.
Alumbrado was sent to Lisbon, in order to counteract the machinations of
the Duke of Braga*za, but having not been able to effect his purpose,
attempted to carry his point by forming a conspiracy, which, if it had
succeeded, would have proved fatal to the life of the new King, and
plunged the empire into the greatest misery.</p>

<p>Unfortunate young man! who hast been implicated in the most enormous
artifices of a monster in that infernal plot; have not all the torments
of Hell raged in thy bosom, when the veil which that arch deceiver had
thrown over that horrid undertaking was removed, when thy seducer was
unmasked before his judges, and thou sawest in whose hands thou hast
been, and how the miracles by which thou hadst been ensnared, had been
wrought? A&nbsp;fragment which I have copied from the records of the
trial, will enable the reader to form an idea of the state of my unhappy

<h4>REFLECTIONS ON WAR.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">On</span> the first
appearance of this dreadful and destructive calamity, the parties more
particularly and personally engaged, are animated with an enthusiastic
ardour, to have an opportunity of signalizing themselves in it. It is
then that the impetuosity of youth, the fervour, the experience, the
sapience, of old age, are called forth in open field, to put in force
the discussions of the cabinet, and to engage with real zeal in the
cause of their country; it is then that every manly breast feels a
warlike impulse thrilling the whole frame! The sound of drums, the
roaring of cannon, the clangor of every species of martial music, rise
figuratively within us: it is then that we should</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“Set the teeth, and stretch the nostrils wide,</p>
<p>Hold hard the breath, and bend up ev’ry spirit</p>
<p>To it’s full height.”</p>

<p class = "right smallcaps">Shakespeare.</p>
</div>

<p>While thus engaged, through the medium of honour, under the
tremendous banners of Mars; buoyed up by him, we sally forth, and bear
down all mortal opposition. We scarcely, in our thoughts, survey the
disconsolate many we left behind; who, though concerned, are not
engaged, in the murderous contest. Flushed with the hopes of suspended
victory, the insignia of triumph hanging doubtful over our heads, whole
hosts advancing to dispute with us our martial prowess, we indulge no
thoughts about those who lament the loss of a father, a&nbsp;child,
a&nbsp;husband, a&nbsp;brother, or a friend.</p>

<p>Stunned with the fatal tidings, which mournfully announce the death
of an affectionate father, behold the wretched family, the disconsolate,
the helpless relict, of a gallant warrior; who, with the bravery of his
arm, supplied the wants of nature to a once happy family: now, robbed of
their entire support, they in vain call out to the manes of their Sire;
in vain invoke all that was most clear to them, to return from the
mouldering dust! But this trying scene is too affecting to demand
expression. Let us, then, survey, in return, the condition of those
venerable parents who weep the loss of their beloved offspring.
A&nbsp;prey to that incessant grief which naturally accompanies those to
whom the fatal loss happens, the worthy sire, and the tender matron,
lament the eternal exit of their ill-fated son; whom, as they nurtured
him in happiness, the tear of genuine affection trickled down the manly
cheek, and the sweet smile of maternal fondness pervaded the mother’s
enraptured looks. Now, that scene of mutual content is changed for
misery, sorrow, and incessant tears. None but parents can conceive their
condition; none but parents picture what it is impossible for the tongue
or pen to describe. Let us, from this scene, turn to view another
equally affecting.</p>

<p>In pourtraying the situation of the disconsolate and mournful widow,
we should find, were we to confine our ideas to her alone, an ample
field for grief and serious consideration. Living, perhaps, in
uninterrupted harmony, friendship, and love, the happy pair, if poor,
supplied the wants of nature with an industrious hand; and,
<span class = "pagenum">300b</span>
if ever persecuted by the hand of mercenary, fickle Fortune, sought in
each others bosom an asylum against the storms of Fate: if rich, perhaps
a bright example of conjugal affection, the love and happiness of all
around, of all connections and dependencies. An adieu, a&nbsp;final
adieu! took place between the brilliant pair, previously to his entering
the plains of Mars. The calls of Honour are loud; the calls of honour
must be obeyed: obeyed they are; and, sacrificed to them, are the best,
the bravest of her votaries! Returning, to behold the situation of the
widow absorbed in grief, we find beauty in distress. Bereft of every
consolation that this life affords, the partner of her joys, the solace
of her cares, and the partaker of her fond embraces, she languishes a
life of widowhood in misery; lamenting the hour that gave her birth, to
linger out a miserable existence in the nursery of Woe. This is one of
the many fatal consequences produced by that aweful, that terrific
hydra, War.</p>

<p>Now, finally, let us survey the condition of the man, who, in the
loss of a real friend, has lost every thing of value in this world. The
sharer, as it were, of his bosom; his comforter in this vale of tears;
his refuge in adversity; and, in short, all that he esteemed; is gone,
in a moment gone, and launched for ever into those boundless realms of
beatitude, “from whose bourne no traveller returns.” Is it the loss of
an affectionate brother he mourns, and yet laments with mental
fortitude? If so, it was friendship indeed! Where two hearts congenial
rise, amicably, fraternally, combining each other’s souls. They lived,
and lived happy in each other, a&nbsp;most unparalleled example of
fraternal amity and love. But, alas! how transitory is this earthly
vision, this temporary bliss! How little to be depended on, our
situation here! These two, who the rugged paths of life together trod,
each other’s souls exchanged, &amp; the sweet balm of friendship tasted,
are separated for ever; never, never to meet, till the massy ambrosial
gates of those mansions of eternal bliss shall be opened to them, where
every vice, and it’s attendant passions, are wrecked to annihilation,
and vanish to eternity!</p>

<p>A few more reflections, and I have done. War, tho’ often productive
of the most solid advantages, is always attended with the most miserable
consequences; and what serves to enrich a few individuals, may reduce
many to misery and want, whose former circumstances were none of the
most inferior sort. Callous, indeed, must be the heart of that man, and
lost to every sense of fellow-feeling, who can behold such scenes, and
not be melted at the sight. These are the consequences of war; of that
war which, when of long duration, entails wretchedness on the greatest
part of the community, and tends to destroy and reduce to general
distress, nations once the envy of the world. Well may we, then, in such
critical <ins class = "correction"

Disposer of all things; and, with fervency of heart, exclaim&mdash;</p>

<h4>ALI AND ORASMIN;</h4>

<p class = "center smallest extended">OR, THE EFFECTS OF ENVY.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">When</span> Muley Mustapha
swayed the Ottoman Empire, lived Ali and Orasmin, sons of two most
eminent Lords in the court of Amurath his father; they were born on the
same day; had been companions from infancy; contemplated together the
stupendous beauties of Nature; scrutinized the complicated labyrinths of
Knowledge; cultivated the heroic discipline of War; and courted the
irresistible Graces calculated to meliorate the ruggedness of the
soldier, and familiarize the pedantic stiffness of the scholar; polish
the invaluable precepts of Wisdom, and make even Virtue’s self more
divine. It was determined at their births, by the Genii of Excellence,
that Ali should surpass Orasmin in beauty of person, strength of body,
and vigor of mind; and though the latter apparently possessed all the
candour and generosity of the former, he was in reality subtle and
selfish; jealous of merit, and impatient of superiority; yet the sacred
zone of friendship was mutually exchanged between them, and they were
the sole confidents of each other.</p>

<p>A soil so ungrateful as the breast of Orasmin was little propitious
to the seeds of amity; especially as increasing maturity confirmed
proportionately the unkind bias of nature. In all their emulatory
exercises, the wreath of victory was the boon of Ali, who wore it with
the most conciliating demeanour; but nothing could reconcile Orasmin to
repeated disappointment; continual defeat increased his chagrin; his
friendship daily subsided; he had recourse to stratagem for triumph, but
the result was ever accumulated mortification; till, at length, envy
took possession of his breast, and was by a most important occurrence
sublimed into a desire of revenge.</p>

<p>Of Amine, the beautiful and virtuous daughter of the Vizier Omar,
they were both enamoured; and both sought her affections, though unknown
to each other: but the talisman of Fortune was in the hand of Ali; and,
by consent of the vizier, the cadi drew up the contract of union between
them. Orasmin attended the celebration of his friends nuptials; but,
while he prayed aloud that Alla might shower down innumerable blessings
on his head, he cursed him in his heart, and from that moment meditated
his destruction. But his resentment he veiled under the garb of extreme
solicitude; and while on his lips dwelt the mellifluous accents of
disinterested profession, the deadly gall of hatred rankled in his soul.
Lo! to the eye, how beautiful appears the serpent of the desart; yet in
his mouth is inserted a barbed sting, and under his tongue is collected
the dark beverage of death!</p>

<p>Orasmin now stedfast in his hate, waited with the utmost anxiety for
a favourable moment to effect his monstrous purposes on his rival, as
the tawny lion of Africa watches an opportunity to spring on his prey:
but the hopes of the envious were vain; the conduct of Ali put Scandal
to shame, and bade defiance to the machinations of Malice.</p>

<p>The pure bliss which the new-married couple enjoyed
<span class = "pagenum">301b</span>
was in the fullness of time heightened extremely by the birth of a son:
but it is written in the ample book of Nature, “That the fairest blossom
shall be blighted, and the green leaf shall not last forever;” and, in
the unutterable volume of Destiny, that&mdash;“The aspect of human
happiness is deceitful as the complexion of the sky; and that the
exquisite season of enjoyment flees away on the light pinions of
impatience.” The son of Amine was stolen from his nurse; and the house
of Ali, from being the mansion of supreme felicity, became on a sudden,
the dwelling of anguish, and the haunt of despair.</p>

<p>An hundred moons had revolved, and Ali and Amine heard not of their
first-born; neither did the all-wise Alla think fit to supply his place
by another. At length, Ali was dispatched on an expedition against the
enemies of the faithful; and Orasmin had the mortification to serve
under him, as second in command. He resolved to thwart him all he could
insidiously: and, by a well-concerted stratagem, and most consummate
address, made so grand diversion in favour of the foe, that the
Musselmen were not only defeated; but, apparently to the whole army,
through the imbecility of the commander in chief, who narrowly escaped
being made a prisoner.</p>

<p>The sagacious Ali, however, though he little suspected the treachery
of Orasmin, knew well where the blame lay; yet rather than his friend
should suffer, nobly chose to keep silence, and himself bear the whole
weight of the Sultan’s displeasure.</p>

<p>The perfidious Orasmin, internally rejoicing at the effect of his
art, with the greatest pleasure received the news, that the generous Ali
was banished his sovereigns presence, and had retired to hide his shame
far from the royal city. Time, however, and the interest of Omar, once
more restored Ali to Mustapha’s favour; he was intrusted, in a full
divan, with an embassy to the Christian states; and returned, after
having concluded his mission in the most honourable manner. But it
should seem that the Genii of Prosperity had resigned his destiny to the
Spirits of Malediction; the sublime satisfaction he received from the
approving smiles of his royal master, were blasted by the intelligence
that Amine, the wife of his bosom, was no more! At his departure, she
had retired to a house which he possessed by the sea-shore; and it was
her custom every evening to ramble among the rocks, as if to look for
his return; from one of these excursions she never returned; and her
attendants concluded that she must have been drowned.</p>

<p>Ali was distracted at the information, and flew from society to bury
his grief in sympathising solitude. In the mean time, partly through
sorrowing for his <ins class = "correction"
title = ", invisible">daughter,</ins> and partly through the dilapidations of time,
the venerable Omar resigned his seat of mortality; and Orasmin, by mere
intrigue, obtained the post of temporary Vizier; as Mustapha had
proclaimed, that no one should be confirmed in it, but he who should
perform an action worthy of such a reward.</p>

<p>Orasmin, however, through the most refined artifice, had almost
induced the Sultan to perpetuate his claim to the viziership; when Nadar
Ismoul, with a formidable
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page302" id = "page302">302</a></span>
army, approached, with all the insolence of a rebel, within two days
march of the royal capital. The voice of rebellion pierced the recesses
of grief; and Ali, rouzed from his desponding lethargy by the imminent
danger of his country, hastened to court, and throwing himself at the
Sultan’s feet, entreated leave to march against Nadar, and retrieve his
former dishonour. Muley readily complied; and Ali took the field with a
less, but a much better disciplined army than that of Nadar: victory
strode before him; the deluded forces of the traitor threw down their
arms, but it was the will of Alla that their leader should escape.</p>

<p>The acclamations of thousands proclaimed the honourable return of
Ali; and Orasmin, making a virtue of necessity, was the first to declare
him worthy of the viziership. He at first hesitated to accept it, for
the memory of Amine had estranged his heart from society; but,
reflecting that man was not made for himself, and that he who slights
the power of doing good is an enemy to human nature, he received it at
the hands of his gracious sovereign with the most zelous and heartfelt
professions of gratitude. The torments of Orasmin increased daily; and,
though he <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for observed?">overserved</ins> the most marked attention to his rival
outwardly, the dark projects of revenge continually absorbed his mind.
An orphan, who from earliest infancy had been under his protection,
loved, and was beloved by his daughter: he had long noticed it, but
concealed that knowledge. One day, when the lovers were enjoying, as
they thought, the blisses of security, he surprized them, and with a
stern frown bade Ibrahim follow him. They entered a private apartment;
when Orasmin, seating himself, thus addressed the youth, who stood
trembling before him&mdash;“Ibrahim, when the Angel of Death deprived
thee of thy parents, and the Angel of Adversity destroyed the fortunes
of thine house, thou was insensible to thy loss. Thy father had been my
most intimate friend, and I took thee under my protection. I&nbsp;have
been to thee as a father, and thou hast been profuse in professions of
gratitude; but it is by deeds alone that we can judge of the sincerity
of the heart, and Orasmin now finds it necessary to put thy gratitude to
trial.” Then, giving him a letter, bade him read it; which the terrified
<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘Ibramin’">Ibrahim</ins>
immediately opening, found to contain these words&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ali Mahomet, to his esteemed friend, Nadar Ismoul, greeting, health
and happiness. To the tyrant Mustapha, despair and death! The plan of
thy defeat was well managed; the credulous Muley is completely deceived,
and has made me vizier: he little dreams, that he has put himself into
the power of his most implacable enemy. I&nbsp;dispatch this by a trusty
messenger; by whom, from time to time, I&nbsp;shall communicate to thee
what steps thou art to take. At present, keep still where thou art; and
I hope soon to call thee from thy hiding-place, to share with me the
empire of the usurping Othmans. Thine in all the ardour of
sincerity.</p>

<p class = "right smallcaps">“Ali Mahomet.”</p>

<p>“Among the talents thou possessest,” continued Orasmin, “thou hast
that of imitating, beyond the possibility
<span class = "pagenum">302b</span>
of detection, the most difficult hand-writing; transcribe then, that
letter in the characters of Ali our vizier, specimens of which I shall
give thee; and if thou succeedest to my wish the hand of my daughter
Almeria, whom thou lovest, shall be thine.” The agitation of surprize
which possessed the youthful Ibrahim, left him not words to reply: he
stammered a few incoherent words; when Orasmin, drawing his scymitar
cried&mdash;“I am not to be trifled! to the task this moment; or, by the
head of Mahomet, thou shalt follow the shade of thy father! But,
I&nbsp;again repeat it, if thou pleasest me, Almeria shall be thine
to-morrow.”</p>

carry small canes, in modish language termed <i>canees</i>, ought to put
them in a horizontal position under their right arm taking especial care
that the ferule end, which must be carried behind them, be sufficiently

look about them, will prevent that crowd of busy people, who infest the
public streets, from pressing too close.</p>

<p>If a short man carry an umbrella, let him lift it no higher, than the
eyes of the overgrown monsters, among the passengers of the street. By
this expedient, he will prevent their coming so near, as to splash him;
at least, if they do, it will be at the hazard of loss of sight.</p>

<p>Such gentlemen, as write their letters in a coffee-house, should
endeavour to procure two or three of the newspapers of the day, to put
under their paper. This will prevent the table soiling their letter, or
their ruffle; as to the impatience of those who wait for news, that is
not the business of a gentleman to inquire about.</p>

<p>If a Coffee-room be crowded, endeavour to fix yourself at the corner
of a table, in such a manner, that you prevent any one passing you to
get seated on any other part of the bench; or, if that cannot

the seat, lean back, whistle, or pick your teeth. This will show your
consequence.</p>

<p>If you walk the streets, always wear boots and spurs, especially in
the summer months, when the ways are clean. I&nbsp;say <i>spurs</i>,
because it is three to one, but they catch the apron or petticoat of
some woman, who is passing you; if she be young and handsome, you may
make a low bow, and ask her pardon, in a <i>degagee</i> way, which may
give birth to an agreeable connexion. Observe the same rule, when you go
to the play-house; besides, if your boots be sufficiently dirty, you
prevent people incommoding you, by crowding a box seat.</p>

<p>Whenever you call a hackney coach, order the driver to stop his
horses, as near as possible to the foot-way. This will naturally

converted into a Slave ship, and became a prison for Afric’s ill-fated
sons.</p>

<p>Near to the shore the vessel lay, until its <i>honourable</i> master
had seen stowed in its hold, far from Aurora’s soul-reviving beams,
sufficient of those beings that were formed in the exact image of his
Creator, to complete his cargo, spread his canvass to the gentle breeze.
The ship, as if partaking in some degree of the spirit of its commander,
proudly mounted the white top’d billows, and exulting in the numbers she
was conducting to their destined port to partake of the bitter draught
of slavery, flew before the wind.</p>

<p>Hitherto the winds had been propitious, and nought had intervened to
disturb the pleasure of the crew. Half

the distance had the vessel measured; and so certain were they of soon
beholding the Island of Barbadoes, that they could have sworn they would
have reached it ere a week had finished. But righteous Heaven, who,
alas! is the only protector of inoffending mortals, grieved to see a
portion of its creatures thus abused, sent to the eyes of the eager
crew, a&nbsp;ship, that bore engines (not of torture, although navigated
by infidels) of war. On her stern majestically waved Britannia’s flag.
Lured by the bait, the eager crew hastened to greet their brethren.
Already was the Captain situated in a place conspicuous, in order to
deliver the accustomed salutation; when oh! a&nbsp;death-blow was given

<h4 class = "six"><span class = "extended">TRUE GENUINE
SENTIMENT</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">True</span> genuine
sentiment may be so connected with the virtue of action, as to bestow on
it its brightest lustre, and its most captivating graces. And enthusiasm
under these circumstances is so far from being disagreeable, that a
portion is indispensibly necessary in an engaging woman; but it must be
of the heart, not of the senses.&mdash;It must grow up with the feeling
mind, and be cherished by a virtuous education, not compounded of
irregular passions and artificially refined by books of unnatural
fiction, and improbable adventure.</p>

<p>But this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched, as it is very
apt to lead those who possess it into inconveniencies from which less
interesting characters are happily exempt.</p>

<p>Strong sensibility may carry a very amiable temper into the most
alarming extremes.<span class = "locked">---</span>The taste of those so
actuated are passions. They love and hate with all their hearts, and
scarcely suffer themselves to feel a reasonable preference, before it
strengthens into a violent attachment.</p>

<p>When an innocent girl of this open, trusting, tender heart, happens
to meet with one of her own sex and age, whose address and manners are
engaging, she is instantly seized with an ardent desire to commence a
friendship with her. She feels the most lively impatience at the
restraint of company and the decorums of ceremony.&mdash;She longs to be
alone with her&mdash;longs to assure her of the warmth of her
tenderness, and generally ascribes to the fair stranger all the good
qualities she feels in her own heart, or rather all those which she has
met with in her reading, dispersed in a variety of heroines.&mdash;She
is persuaded that her new friend unites them all in herself, because the
carries in her prepossessing countenance the promise of them all.</p>

<p>If hints of her defects are given, she mistakes the voice of
discretion. At first she listens to them with a generous impatience, and
afterwards with a cold and silent disdain, and despises them as the
effect <ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘or’">of</ins>
prejudice, misrepresentation, <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘of’">or</ins> ignorance.</p>

<p>Yet this trusting confidence, this honest indiscretion, is, at this
early period of life, as amiable as it is natural; and will, if wisely
cultivated, produce at its proper
<span class = "pagenum">305b</span>
season, fruits infinitely more valuable than all the guarded
circumspection of premature, and therefore artificial prudence. Nay, if
the younger part of the sex are sometimes deceived in the choice of a
friend, they enjoy even then an higher degree of satisfaction than if
they never trusted&mdash;For to be always clad in the burthensome armour
of suspicion is more painful and inconvenient, than to run the hazard of
suffering, now and then, a&nbsp;transient injury.</p>

<p>These observations chiefly respect the inexperienced; for it is a
certainty that women are capable of as faithful and as durable
friendship as any of the other sex. They can enter not only into all the
enthusiastic tenderness, but into all the solid fidelity of
attachment.</p>


<p class = "twin w33">&nbsp;</p>

<h4><span class = "super">RIDICULE</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> fatal fondness
for indulging a spirit of ridicule, and the injurious and irreparable
consequences which sometimes attend the too severe reply, can never be
condemned with more asperity than it deserves. Not to offend is the
first step towards pleasing. To give pain is as much an offence against
humanity as against good-breeding; and surely it is as well to abstain
from an action because it is sinful, as because it is impolite.</p>

<p>A man of sense and breeding will sometimes join in the laugh, which
has been raised at his expence by an ill natured repartee; but if it was
very cutting, and one of those shocking sorts of truths, which, as they
scarcely can be pardoned even in private, ought never to be uttered in
public, he does not laugh because he wishes to conceal how much he is
hurt; and will remember it, as a treat of malice, when the whole company
should have forgotten it as a stroke of ridicule.</p>

<p>Even women are so far from being privileged by their sex to say
unhandsome or cruel things, that it is this very circumstance which
renders them intolerable. When the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is
no relief to him who is wounded to reflect, that the hand which shot it
was a fair one.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">It</span> gave me great
pleasure to have found out a mean through which I could influence you
and the Marquis at once, and guide both of you to one mark.
I&nbsp;feared, however, the Marquis of <span class =
"locked">F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span> would discover my
artifices, and for that reason recommended him to the King by a third
person, for the transaction of affairs which removed him far enough
from&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>Duke. Infernal villainy! execrable wretch!&mdash;&mdash;But no, your
deeds contradict your profession. No, Alumbrado, human art cannot
produce miracles like yours. Did not nature herself obey you?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. Your imagination only obeyed me. The idea of the
miraculous had been instilled in your mind already, and I had nothing
else to do but to strengthen it, in order to get possession of the
confidence which Hiermanfor had enjoyed. I&nbsp;thought it, however,
prudent to use a different method. He founded his supernatural power on
the occult sciences, and I on religious mysteries.</p>

<p>I did not find it more difficult to lead you from the delusions of
speculative philosophy, to those of implicit faith, than to give you
proofs of my miraculous power. A&nbsp;little dexterity, a&nbsp;little
success on my part, and a judicious accommodation to circumstances,
delivered you and the Marquis into my power. I&nbsp;gained my purpose,
and this was the only miracle in the whole affair.</p>

<p>Duke. However, the effects which you produced, are still so very
mysterious to&nbsp;me.&mdash;</p>

<p>Alumbrado. And yet every thing was done in a very natural manner.</p>

<p>Duke. How could you know the accident that happened at the Inn at
*li*, in the very moment when it took place.</p>

<p>Alumbrado. Because I had preconcerted it with some of my emissaries
at *li*. You now will comprehend how I could know the day and the hour,
and how that incident could agree so exactly with my <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘predicton’">prediction</ins>.</p>

<p>Duke. What end did you mean to gain by that deception?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. The throwing down of the picture by an invisible hand, was
to give you a hint that a higher power had decreed the dethronement of
the King.</p>

<p>Duke. However, the appeasing of the tempestuous sea could be no
delusion, nor an accident. Through what extraordinary means did you
effect&nbsp;it?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. Mere precaution enabled me to effect it. Experience had
taught me that oil possesses the extraordinary quality of restoring the
equilibrium of the water, if violently agitated, and of smoothing the
swelling waves. For that reason I have been used never to make a voyage
without carrying some casks of oil with me; and I had taken the same
precaution when I went on board of the vessel in which you had taken
<span class = "pagenum">306b</span>
your passage. Having left you, I&nbsp;ordered my people to beat off the
hoops of the casks and throw them overboard. The oil instantly spread
over the surface of the water and calmed the agitated waves.<a class =
"plain" name = "tag306" id = "tag306" href = "#note306">*</a></p>

<p>Duke. [After a pause] It was your intention to persuade me to return
to Lis*n, and you have gained your aim by that expedient; but what would
you have done if no tempest had afforded you an opportunity of deceiving
me by a pretended miracle?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. I should have watched another opportunity, and devised
other artifices; for it was with that view that I accompanied you on
your voyage without your knowledge.</p>

<p>Duke. By what means did you preserve your life, under the hands of
the royal banditti?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. The whole scene you beheld from the top of the turret was
pre-concerted by me. The fellows who attacked me, neither had been sent
by the King, nor were they banditti, <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘hut’">but</ins> had been previously instructed by me how to
act; their pistols were charged only with powder, and their poniards did
not wound me. This will explain to you the whole miracle.</p>

<p>Duke. Not sent by the King, did you say. He then had no design
against my life?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. No, the King never had the least idea of such a deed.</p>

<p>Duke. Villainous! villainous! to deceive me thus!&mdash;And with what
view did you devise that horrid fraud?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. I wanted to inflame your father’s mind with resentment
against the King. Nay, I&nbsp;will tell you more. It was <ins class =
"correction" title = "italicized in Dublin edition">my</ins> work that
the King treated you with so much coldness, and neglected to raise your
family: for I had represented you and your father to him, by one of my
agents, as persons who beheld his new dignity with envious eyes. Through
these mutual exasperations, I&nbsp;gained the advantage of increasing
your personal antipathy against the King, and of turning <ins class =
"correction" title = ", missing">it,</ins> at length, into hatred that
had all the appearance of just resentment.</p>

<p>Duke. Ah! I now begin to penetrate the whole atrocity of your artful
wiles. Then it was you who has <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: London and Dublin editions have ‘incited’">excited</ins> the
King against me and my family, and formed the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: London and Dublin editions have ‘plot’">plots
</ins> against his life?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. What would it avail me to deny the charge?</p>

<p>Duke. And yet it seemed as if you had not been concerned in the
conspiracy. The design against the King had already been determined, and

I should have destroyed my own work if I had stepped forth too soon. My
seeming backwardness spurred you on, and screened me from suspicion.
However, after I had performed the last fictitious miracle,
I&nbsp;thought myself sufficiently secured against all suspicion, and
calculated that it would be <ins class = "correction"
title = "text
unchanged: error for ‘seasonable’ as in Dublin edition?">reasonable</ins> to command you in the name of God to take an
active part in the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Duke. After the last fictitious miracle? Do you mean that incident by
which you showed yourself proof against ball and dagger?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. I do. The miracle will appear very natural to you when I
tell you that I had filled the powder-horn, which I had conveyed
secretly from your apartment, with a powder of my own invention, which
could not carry the ball <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘father’">farther</ins> than five steps. Having placed myself seven
steps distant from the gun, I&nbsp;was far enough out of harm’s way.
I&nbsp;requested to be fired at twice, in order to empty the powder-horn
of its contents, a&nbsp;precaution that prevented you from discovering,
afterwards, the real nature of the powder. The dagger with which I
stabbed myself, had also been previously made for that purpose, and
could do me no harm. The blade of it, which was not much pointed,
snapped back into the hollow handle on the smallest resistance, which
made you believe that it had penetrated my breast. A&nbsp;spring which
forced it again into its former situation, rendered it entirely
impossible for you to discover the fraud.</p>

<p>Duke. What views had you in making me believe that you was
invulnerable?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. Was it not to be expected that you would repose the utmost
reliance on the assistance of a man who should appear to you proof
against balls and daggers?</p>

<p>However, I have, as yet, explained to you only the particular views I
had in performing fictitious miracles, and now will tell you that every
one of them tended to effect a general end, which was nothing less than
to persuade you and the Marquis to believe that God was working and
speaking through me. Our plot was so hazardous, the circumstances so
unfavourable, and success so improbable, that we had reason to apprehend
you would shrink back from your resolution, when you should have
pondered more maturely the danger which it was attended with. For this
reason I thought it most prudent to appear to you to be an organ of the
godhead, because it was to be expected that you would fear no danger
whatever, if you should be persuaded that our design was the work of
God, and supported by his omnipotent power; for with God nothing is
impossible. In order to corroborate you in that belief, I&nbsp;advised
you to have recourse to <ins class = "correction"
title = "word italicized in book editions">prayer</ins>.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Duke. Daring wretch! how could you run that risk?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. Why not? you had already taken your resolution before you
implored God to signify his will to you. The execution of our plan had
been, some time
<span class = "pagenum">307b</span>
since, the <ins class = "correction"
title = "spelling unchanged">principle</ins> idea that prevailed in your mind, and forced
itself upon you on every occasion, and, of course, in your prayers too;
it was, therefore, very natural that in the latter case, you should
mistake for a decree of God, what, in reality, was nothing else but the
voice of your provoked passions. I&nbsp;entertained not the least
apprehension that devotion would produce more pious sentiments in your
mind, because the sophistry of your passions, and the two prelates had
already persuaded you that our design was just; I&nbsp;rather expected
that the fervour of your prayer, particularly at night, would increase
the fermentation of your blood, and animate you with additional courage
to execute our plan.</p>

<p>Duke. Infernal spirit! but no! thou art worse than Satan! for he
respects the temples and altars, but thou hast laid thy snares even in
those sacred places. <ins class = "correction"
title = "word italicized in book editions">Prayers</ins> and <ins class = "correction" title =

of man become in thy hand tools of seduction; and thou dost not tremble
at the idea of being accountable to the all-seeing Judge for thy
villainous deeds?&mdash;What wouldst thou have done, daring wretch! if a
ray of divine illumination had dispelled my errors?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. I was not afraid of that. You could expect no such
illumination from above, because your own reason would have pointed out
to you the illegality of your design, if you had consulted your own good
sense rather than your passions. God does not work miracles while we can
be instructed by natural means.</p>

<p>Duke. But suppose he had, for how canst thou prescribe limits to the
wisdom of God, suppose he had, nevertheless, condescended to open mine
eyes through his holy spirit?</p>

<p>Alumbrado. (carelessly.) I then should have had recourse to a natural
expedient&mdash;which I intended to adopt in case of emergency. You will
recollect that you missed a sheet of your treatise on the <ins class =
"correction" title = "phrase italicized in book editions">Manicheean
system</ins>; it was I who purloined it. If you had shrunk back from
your engagement, I&nbsp;would have threatened you with all the terrors

Inquisitor my friend; consequently now <ins class = "correction" title =

choice was left you, than either to make good your engagement or to
experience all the horrors of that tribunal.</p>

<p>Duke, shuddering with horror. Lead me back to my dungeon, lest the
aspect of this monster should poison me intirely.</p>

<p>The day after the trial, the son of the gaoler brought me a letter,
which, to my utter astonishment, was from the Duke, and contained the

<h4>A <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for ‘panegyric’ as in Index">PENEGYRIC</ins> UPON IMPUDENCE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Orators</span> and men of
wit have frequently amused themselves with maintaining paradoxes. Thus,
Erasmus has written a penegyric upon <i>folly</i>: Montaigne has said
fine things upon <i>ignorance</i>, which he somewhere calls “the softest
pillow a man can lay his head upon:” and Cardan, in his Encomium
Neronis, has, I&nbsp;suppose, defended every vice and every folly. It is
astonishing to me, that no one has yet done justice to <i>impudence</i>;
which has so many advantages, and for which so much may be said. Did it
never strike you, what simple, naked, uncompounded <i>impudence</i> will
do? what strange and astonishing effects it will produce? Aye, and
without birth, without property, without principle, without even
artifice and address, without indeed any single quality, but “the front
of three-fold brass.”</p>

<p>Object not folly, vice, or villainy however black: these are puny
things: from a visage truly bronzed and seared, from features muscularly
fixed and hardened, issues forth a broad overpowering glare, by which
all these are as totally hid, as the spots of the sun by the lustre of
his beams. Were this not so, how is it, that impudence shall make
impressions to advantage; shall procure admission to the highest
personages, <i>and no questions asked</i>; shall suffice (in short) to
make a man’s fortune, where no modest merit could even render itself
visible? I&nbsp;ask no more to insure success, than that there be but
enough of it: without success a man is ruined and undone there being no
mean. Should one ravage half the globe, and destroy a million of his
fellow-creatures, yet, if at length he arrive at empire, as Cæsar did,
he shall be admired while living as an hero, and adored perhaps almost
as a god when dead: though, were the very same person, like Cataline, to
fail in the attempt, he would be hanged as a scoundrel robber, and his
name devoted to infamy or oblivion.</p>

<p>But to proceed. Pray, what do you think the elder Pliny suggests,
when he affirms it to be “the prerogative of the Art of Healing, that
any man, who professes himself a physician, is instantly received as
such?” He certainly suggests, that such sort of professors in his days,
like itinerant and advertising phisicians, had a more than ordinary
portion of that bold, self-important and confident look and manner,
which, with a very little heightening, may justly be called impudence.
And what but this could enable a little paltry physician, of no name or
character, to gain so mighty an ascendency over such a spirit, as that
of Lewis XI. of France? Read the account in Philip de Comines; and then
blame me, if you can, for thinking so highly of this
accomplishment.&mdash;True it is, Lewis was afraid of death even to
horror, and so as not to <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for bear">bare</ins> the sound of the word; and I
grant, that on this same fear the empire of physic, is in a great
measure founded.</p>

<p>Pope Gregory VII. who governed the church from 1073 to 1085, is
celebrated for having carried ecclesiastical dominion to the height: for
he was the first who maintained and established, that popes, by
excommunication,
<span class = "pagenum">308b</span>
may depose kings from their states, and loose subjects from their
allegiance. And how did he effect this? Not by genius or eloquence; not
by a knowledge of canon law, and the constitutions of the holy see; no,
nor by the arts of policy and grimaces of his religion (with all which
others had been endowed as well as&nbsp;he) but by a most insolent,
daring, usurping spirit. He seized the papal chair by force, as it were
threw the church into confusion to gratify his ambition; made kings his
slaves, and bishops his creatures; and established in his own person a
tyranny over things both spiritual and temporal.<span class =

that he immediately retaliated upon his enemy with his heavy weapon,

a private passage, through which the Emperor always passed when wont to
survey the royal city in disguise; and which, by having been vizier, he
was well acquainted with: and having, while in office, procured false
keys to the various doors, he easily found admission to the secret
audience-chamber, where none but the vizier can enter, on pain of death,
without permission of the Sultan; and there leaving the letter, he
returned to his house, exulting in the hope that Mustapha would discover
it, when he retired there alone, as was his custom every night, to
inspect such dispatches as the vizier in the day prepared for his
approbation: trusting the success of his plan on the extreme credulity
and impetuosity of that monarch, which hurried him into actions that
provided him the most severe repentance for his moments of
reflection.</p>

<p>The event justified his most sanguine expectations; and, before the
first watch of the night was passed, a&nbsp;hasty messenger summoned him
to a secret audience in the palace. The sultan presented him with the
letter; he read it, and appeared petrified with astonishment; compared
the writing with some of Ali’s he had purposely brought with him, to
satisfy himself of it’s identity; then, bemoaning the defalcation of his
friend, in accents of the most artfully counterfeited grief, and after
an apparent struggle between duty and friendship&mdash;“Glory,” said he,
“to God and his prophet! Long life to the Commander of the Faithful! and
destruction to his enemies! The profound duty every Mussulman owes to
the vicegerent of Alla, obliges me to dispense with the scruples of an
ill-placed friendship; and declare, that the conduct of Ali has long
appeared to me as involved in the veil of mystery; the plausible manner
in which he has ever demeaned himself, I&nbsp;have discovered, beyond a
doubt, has been only a bait for popularity; too ardent a love for which
is a certain criterion of unwarrantable ambition.</p>

<p>“I once had the mortification to witness the shameful defeat of the
Ottoman arms, under his command: I&nbsp;had then many reasons to suspect
treachery; but the implicit confidence I, with the empire at large, put
in him, made me discredit my own senses; and it was the same infatuation
which induced me to be the foremost in declaring him the most eligible
for the viziership, when returned from meeting the rebel Ismoul.</p>

<p>“Yet, when I reflect, in sober reason, on the nature of that action,
and behold the insurgents, though greatly

right, Orasmin!” interrupted the enraged Mustapha: “convey him instantly
to a dungeon; and to-morrow’s sun shall behold inflicted on him the
reward of his treachery!”&mdash;“Will it please the gracious emblem of
Alla,” replied Orasmin, “to listen a moment longer, without anger, to
his slave; while he offers, as Alla himself can witness, the counsel
only dictated by that unshaken attachment ever evinced by his house to
the renowned family of the Othmans!”&mdash;“Speak on, and fear not,”
returned Mustapha. Orasmin proceeded&mdash;“Thou knowest well,
O&nbsp;glory of thy race! that Ali is the idol of the deluded multitude;
and, should they behold him going forth to execution, what desperate
steps may not their blind attachment induce them to take for his
preservation? And a commotion once begun, as we know not how far the
treason <ins class = "correction" title = "s invisible">has</ins>
spread, may encourage hundreds of accomplices in the guilt to come
forward; and, led by Nadar who doubtless is at hand, induce the populace
to join the compact of treason, release Ali, and shake perhaps even the
foundation of the Ottoman throne? Let policy, then, bid Justice strike
this night; so, the root of the confederacy being cut away, the branches
shall necessarily wither; and when to-morrow’s sun shall expose the
traitor’s head, branded with his crime, to the trembling people, thy
subjects shall be more firmly fixed in their obedience&mdash;taught by
the awful lesson, that the most exalted enemies of Mustapha are the

him instantly dispatched! Be this,” presenting his ring, “thy warrant.

him, till he beheld him extended on the floor of a loathsome dungeon,
secured by the pondrous manacles of injustice. On entering, having
ordered the guard to withdraw&mdash;“Mahomet!” said he, “is it my noble

Orasmin continued, “From the hour that early youth submitted me to the
scourgings of a pedagogue, thou hast

Thinkest thou, that I could have a spirit, and bear it? No! the childish
weaknesses of friendship I soon got rid of; and, from the moment thou
deprived me of all hope of possessing the sorceress Amine,

lost my friend, my wife, and my child!”&mdash;“Friend,” interrupted
Orasmin, “thou never hadst! Thy wife and child&mdash;&mdash;But, hold!

Orasmin assumed a desperate sullenness; the Sultan and Ibrahim surveyed
the whole in silence. “Alla! Alla! Alla!” repeated the reviving Ali;
“thou art merciful! thou art merciful!”</p>

<p>“My dear lord,” interrupted Amine, “dreary have been the hours since
we parted! O&nbsp;hear my justification! While walking by the seaside,
a&nbsp;band of men, masked, beset me; and, forcing me on a horse,
carried me, blind-folded, I&nbsp;knew not where; for when suffered to

door of which was secured. There have I remained, in vain lamenting my
fate; ignorant of my oppressor; and seeing no one, except a slave, who
put my food through a lattice daily, but never spoke; till this night I
heard the voice of Orasmin in a tone of threatening.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“I</ins>

Ibrahim, to write a treasonous letter in characters like yours. When I

that I had never before observed it. I&nbsp;told him who I was, and

“ready to do thee justice, Ali; and inflict on that wretch the

this night is his last!” “My fate is just!” said Orasmin, in a tone of

“which must soon be repented! I&nbsp;stole thy child solely for the
purposes of revenge; though fortune never, till now, gave me an
opportunity of making use of him equal to my wishes; and, to make him
the source of his father’s death, was a stroke worthy the noblest policy
of vengeance. Thou hast escaped me; but, to give him thus kindly, were
an inequality of soul, poor indeed! No I have pangs for thee yet in

reach; but the boy had answered the end I designed him for:
I&nbsp;wanted him no more; and, at liberty, he might have betrayed me.
For security, I&nbsp;gave him poison in sherbet; and thought, even had
he got free, so strong it was, that it would have worked faster than his

<p>“The vengeance be on thine own head!” cried Ibrahim; “for it was
thyself who drank the poison. I&nbsp;saw thee drop something in the

thee, Mahomet! thou hast frustrated all!” “Hence with him!” said
Mustapha. And then led Amine and Ibrahim out of the prison. By
permission of the Sultan, Ibrahim was united to Almeria; and the

<h4>ON INDUSTRY.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> absurd
indulgence with which parents anticipate every wish of their children
often paves the way for their destruction, and entirely unfits them for
returning that affectionate care which is due to the authors of their
being. How many instances do we see of the ill effects of such misplaced
kindness. By supplying children with all the superfluities of life, we
at once weaken the springs of exertion, and induce a habit of indolence
fatal to future improvement; for why should they exert themselves to
procure that which is ready at their call? Virtuous habits and habits of
industry are nearly the same; and since these only are productive of
happiness, it is of the utmost importance to teach the youthful mind
that enjoyment and self-satisfaction must be purchased by labour.<span
class = "locked">---</span>Happy is the man, who, in early life, has
been taught by experience the blessed effects of honest industry, and
the inestimable value of time. Multiply <i>time</i> by <i>industry</i>,
and what is the result?&mdash;Peace of mind; the innocent enjoyment of
life, and every thing that can exalt human nature.</p>

<p>By Industry, I must not be understood to mean the incessant drudging
pursuit after sorded gain:<span class = "locked">---</span>I have
likewise reference to mental industry; the improvement of that
intellectual part of our existence which elevates our view above this
narrow scene of things, and teaches us to soar to heaven.</p>

<h4>MILITARY ANECDOTE</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A new</span> formed corps
of Volunteers were one day exercising in a park, where a Bull was kept,
and where he had been accustomed to enjoy unresisted sovereignty.
Whether displeased with the aukwardness of their manœuvres, offended at
their intrusion on the scene of his pleasure, or regarding their martial
music as a challenge of defiance on his own territory, the Lordly Animal
advanced with a menacing air; and notwithstanding some attempts at
resistance, charged the line, broke through the ranks, and after having
completely routed and dispersed the enemy, remained undisputed master of
the field!</p>

observations in the following celebrated sentence of Lactantius<span

<p>Professor Richardson’s observation, that men judge of objects
according to their peculiar habits, and that a beautiful lawn, which
excites pastoral ideas in the poet’s mind, suggests the value of the
land to the miser, is exemplified by the following:</p>

<p>An old Epicure, walking one fine morning, in the meadows on the banks
of a river, exclaimed with rapture
<span class = "pagenum">311b</span>
at the sight of a lamb that was frisking about “pretty innocent
creature, how deliciously thou wouldst eat with carrots or
cauliflowers.”</p>

<p>Sir John Salter, who died in 1605, and was a generous benefactor to
the worshipful company of Salters, ordered, in his last will and
testament, the beadles and servants of the company, to go to the church
of St. Magnus, the first week of every October, and knock upon his grave
stone, with sticks and staves three times each person, and say, “How do
you do brother Salter? I&nbsp;hope you are well.”</p>

<h4 class = "ital"><em>EXTRACT</em> from a <em>LETTER</em> to <span
class = "smallcaps">Miss</span> ****.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">&mdash;Since</span> we both
fancy ourselves unhappy, permit me, in this place, to make a few serious
reflections on the extreme mutableness and instability of all
terrestrial felicity; and the long duration and permanency of misfortune
and disappointment. Those halcyon days I oft remember, when I enjoyed
the pleasure of your society. Then, indeed, I&nbsp;tasted for a moment,
something like unmixed happiness: not a wave of sorrow rolled across my
breast; nor was corroding care an inmate of my bosom. The loveliness of
the season, in union with the serenity of the atmosphere, conspired to
increase my tranquility, and to render every thing delightful. When we
sailed gently down the harbour, the clear cerulean of the sky added a
softer beauty to the adjacent landscapes, and rendered the prospect
enchanting. When we strayed over the flowery fields, or penetrated the
leafy grove, the flocks grazing the green herbage, the zephyrs rustling
through the trees, and the birds warbling on the branches, exhibited a
resemblance of the pristine happiness of ancient Eden. And when
listlessly wandering on the rocky beach, the idle murmuring of the waves
upon the sandy shore, the confused gabbling of the sea fowl, and the
distant view of the “full spread vessel majestically advancing over the
white <ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘cap’d’">capp’d</ins>
billows,” tended to sooth the sorrows of humanity, and lull the mind to
quietude. The day ended, and still evening drew on. Then did nature
appear in silent magnificence; while the silver rays of the full orbed
moon shed a majesty on each surrounding object. The lofty summit of the
cloud-topt mountain appeared in solemn grandeur; the dusky forest
reflected a yellow radiance; and the rolling wonders of the skies
glittered over our heads: while the awful stillness that reigned,
interrupted only by the lonely strains of the whip-poor-will, <!--
escaped from Alonzo and Melissa --> served to exalt the soul, and
distend the heart.</p>

<p>These were beatific seasons of bliss&mdash;golden moments indeed,
while they lasted, but, alas! where are they fled? They have vanished
like the fading glories of the west,
<span class = "pagenum">313b</span>
when the illustrious monarch of day resigns our hemisphere to the sable
goddess of darkness. Or like the gay delusions of a morning dream, which
only tantalize the mind with the prospect of unsubstantial happiness,
and render the real evils of life more intolerable. A&nbsp;true, but
melancholy picture of unhappy man. Joy, for a moment, expands his
countenance with smiles; but it is suddenly overclouded with a gloom of
sadness, and misery and woe become his inseparable companions. Youth and
beauty just open into bloom; and then are succeeded by the solicitudes
of manhood, and the dull unjoyous season of old age. Humiliating
reflections are these to the sorrowing child of humanity: yet, where
virtue has a residence in the heart, she quickly calms the throbbing
breast, and allays the gathering storm of affliction. ’Tis virtue alone
that can enable the soul to bear up cheerfully against the calamities of
life, and give her a joyful assurance of happiness in a future state.
Virtue will command respect among men, adorn the wrinkles of age with
dignity, and crown the hoary head with respect. It will shine forth in
the evening of life, like the refulgent glories of a setting sun, and
glow with increasing splendor in never-ending worlds.</p>

<p>This invaluable jewel, I admit not the least doubt, dear madam, but
you possess; and it is the great object of my pursuit. Then let life’s
tempestuous ocean roar, and fortune inauspiciously frown upon us; we
shall surely outride the stormy gale, and ere long make the blessed port
of an happy immortality.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Grief</span>, horror, pity,
hope, and despair assailed my heart alternately, after I had read this
letter. I&nbsp;moistened it with burning tears. When this violent
agitation of my mind began to abate so much that I could reflect again,
I&nbsp;considered what could be done for the preservation of this
hapless man, and regardless of my indisposition, hastened to the
archbishop of Lis*on, who always had been very partial to the Duke, and
was much respected by the Queen. I&nbsp;entreated this worthy prelate to
intercede with the latter for my hapless friend. “Alas!” he replied,
“I&nbsp;have attempted it already without success.” “How, my Lord?” her
reply was, “how can you intercede for a traitor who has meditated our
destruction and the ruin of our kingdom. All that you can expect is,
that I shall forget what you have asked.”</p>

<p>This account of the archbishop rent my heart; however, I entertained
still some hope that the King, whose generous disposition I knew, would
not prove callous against my tears and prayers. I&nbsp;went without
delay to the palace, and was admitted. I&nbsp;supplicated him on my
knees, to grant his royal mercy to the unfortunate deluded young man,
and exerted every power of eloquence to excite his pity. “Rise,
Marquis,” the King replied, “there is no occasion for your intercession;
I&nbsp;have determined already to pardon the Duke and the rest of the
conspirators; yet their fate does not depend on myself alone, but also
from the decision of the Council of State.” With that resolution I was
dismissed.</p>

<p>The following day, the gaoler brought me a second letter from the
Duke, which I shall transcribe literally:</p>

<p class = "inset smallcaps">“My Dearest Friend,</p>

<p>“I am allowed to converse with you once more. The 200 dobras have
gained the gaoler, and the promise of a like sum has prompted him to
engage to deliver this letter to you. I&nbsp;must inform you of an
important incident, that happened last night, within the walls of my
dungeon. The door of my prison was suddenly flung open, and
<i>Hiermanfor</i> entered. Although I have great reason to be angry with
him, yet he appeared to me an angel of light, in comparison with
Alumbrado. The sight of him roused my heart from its state of
despondency; however, my former gloominess of mind soon returned, when
after a long and solemn silence, he exclaimed: “must we meet again in
<i>this</i> place?”</p>

<p>“I could return no answer; the consciousness of my guilt lay heavy on
my mind, and the looks of the Irishman confounded me. Without being
affected by my perplexity, he resumed, after a short silence: “you was a
noble, deserving young man when I left you, and now I find you a rebel.”
I&nbsp;do not know whether it was the accent in which
<span class = "pagenum">314b</span>
he pronounced these words, or the truth they implied, that made my blood
ferment on a sudden&mdash;in short, I&nbsp;exclaimed: “if you had
fulfilled your promise as an honest man, I&nbsp;should then perhaps not
have been in this situation.” The Irishman seemed to be affected
vehemently. “By heaven! my Lord!” he exclaimed, “it was no fault of
mine, a&nbsp;journey, and business of great importance, prevented me
from seeing you sooner. But I do not comprehend you sufficiently, will
you be so kind as to explain the meaning of your words?”</p>

<p>“I will, as soon as you shall have given me an explanation of an
incident which you have promised to clear&nbsp;up.”</p>

<p>“What incident do you mean?” the Irishman said.</p>

<p>“The apparition of Antonio, at the church-yard. Was it a natural
contrivance of your invention?”</p>

<p>“It was.”</p>

<p>“Merciful God!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me, the explanation&mdash;the explanation&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The apparition was effected by means of a convex mirror; the vision
which you wanted to embrace, was nothing else but the image of a statue
of your tutor, which was reflected on the spot where it appeared by a
mirror placed before that statue.”</p>

<p>“But how did it happen that the mirror escaped my observation?”</p>

<p>“You will recollect that the vision appeared not far from the chapel,
behind the wall of which the mirror was placed in such a manner that it
could not be perceived by you.”</p>

<p>“And Antonio’s statue?”</p>

<p>“You would have observed it if the sight of the apparition had not
engrossed your whole attention; however, its having been painted white
like the rest of the statues in the church-yard, probably would have
induced you to mistake it for the statue of some saint or other, and
thus it would not have attracted your attention.”</p>

<p>“But how could the apparition disappear and re-appear at my
desire?”</p>

<p>“That was not difficult. One of my people, who directed the mirror
through one of the church windows, removed it when the vision
disappeared, and replaced it again in its proper situation when you
desired the phantom to appear once more.”</p>

<p>“But if I had discovered the artifice?&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe that I had taken the necessary precaution? Even if
you had seen the mirror, yet you would not have discovered its effect.
I&nbsp;was, however, pretty sure that you would not enter into an
examination, being well aware that you would have no inclination of
doing it, because I had desired you to make every investigation you
should wish, and thus prompted you to believe that I apprehended no
discovery.”</p>

<p>“However, the phantom spoke, how could that be?”</p>

<p>“Not the phantom, but Count Clairval, who was in the gallery of the
chapel, spoke through a speaking trumpet. The direction of the trumpet,
and the striking resemblance
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page315" id = "page315">315</a></span>
the phantom bore to your tutor, induced you to attribute the words which
he pronounced to the vision.”</p>

<p>“Hiermanfor,” said I after a pause, <ins class = "correction" title =
"open quote missing (at page break in London edition)">“then</ins> your
last miracle too was a delusion?”</p>

<p>“You have my confession.”</p>

<p>“And nevertheless you assured me so solemnly that it was the work of
super-natural power!”</p>

<p>“I did so; but I intended to recant after the end which I had in view
should have been attained. Unforeseen incidents prevented me from doing
it sooner.”</p>

<p>“Why did not Count Clairval recant in your name, when I entreated him
so solemnly and so pressing to confess the fraud?”</p>

<p>“He had received no orders to that purpose.”</p>

<p>“You promised me, one time, to initiate me in a new philosophy, and
to introduce me to an happiness that is concealed from other
mortals.”</p>

<p>“Then I promised you what I am not able to perform. Without
circumlocution, I&nbsp;imposed upon you!”</p>

<p>“And you have the courage to tell me this to my face?”</p>

<p>“I have spoken the truth, and hope you will forgive me. Yes,
I&nbsp;have deceived you, and the success of the revolution depended
chiefly upon that innocent fraud. I&nbsp;deceived you
because&mdash;forgive me my frankness&mdash;because you would be
deceived.”</p>

<p>“Your morality agrees pretty well with your policy.”</p>

<p>“I am astonished,” the Irishman replied with a contemptuous smile,
“that <i>you</i> presume to call my morality in question; the clangor of
these fetters contrasts very much with your moral speeches.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely able to retain my rising indignation, I&nbsp;replied, “But
if I could prove that this innocent fraud, as you please to call it, has
been the chief cause of my crime, of these fetters, and of my impending
execution!”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid it!” the Irishman exclaimed, seized with terror.</p>

<p>“You have excited by your delusions my propensity to miraculous
events. The explanation of your deceptions did not at all destroy the
dangerous effect they produced on my mind, because I never was able to
recover entirely from the erroneous opinion that the apparition of the
church-yard had been the effect of supernatural power. An infernal
impostor took advantage of the situation of my mind, and incited me
through new delusions to engage in the undertaking that has been the
cause of these fetters. Are you now sensible of the injury I have
suffered through you?”</p>

<p>“The Irishman grew pale, and seemed deprived of the power of
utterance. At once he recovered from his sudden terror, and started up.
“Whither are you going?” I&nbsp;exclaimed. “To the King!” he replied.
“What business have you with the King?” I&nbsp;enquired. <ins class =

set you at liberty. Forgive me, unfortunate young man! (he added)

preservation of your life.” So saying, he left me, and I have not seen
him since. I&nbsp;must patiently await the effect of his
<span class = "pagenum">315b</span>
application. Farewell! my friend, farewell! I&nbsp;am not afraid of
leaving this world, for Amelia is dead, Antonio is no more, and alas! my
father too will be condemned to die. However, the idea of dying branded
with ignominy, thrills me with terror and desponding agony. Gracious
Heaven, ward off this dreadful blow, if it be possible!”</p>

<p>Hesitating between hope and fear, I awaited the day which was to
decide the fate of my hapless friend. It arrived.</p>

<p>My melancholy tale draws nearer towards its conclusion! why does my
hand tremble thus? why do these tears start from my eyes? what means
this dreadful agony that almost breaks my heart? Alas! thy doom is
fixed, ill-fated victim of delusion!</p>

decreed that the Marquis of Villa Re*l and the Duke of Ca*ina, should be
beheaded as rebels against the King, whose authority they had

<h4>ANECDOTES.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A wild</span> young fellow
was going abroad: His mother took him up into her closet, telling him
she had a precious treasure to deposit in his hands, and after many
grave admonitions produced the Bible, handsomely bound in two volumes;
and, to crown all, advised him to consult and search the scriptures.
Little did the youth know how precious the volumes were; but you shall
hear. On his return from sea, the old lady one day took him aside, and
hoped he had remembered the last injunction she had given him: “Yes, he
could very honestly say he had taken care of the Bible.” To prove his
respect and obedience, he runs up stairs to his own room, and returns
instantly, with the two volumes safe and sound.</p>

<p>The good lady pulls off one cover: “Rather too clean, my dear.”
“O&nbsp;madam, I&nbsp;took great care of them: the second volume is
equally fair.” She shakes her head; intimating her suspicions that they
had not been read so often as she wished: Then opens the first volume,
and, lo! a&nbsp;ten pound bank note is found: the second volume displays
a second note, and of twice the value. She was confounded; and so was
her son: And I know no man, of my acquaintance, who more sincerely
regrets that he did not <i>search the scriptures</i>.</p>

<p class = "center smallest"><span class = "extended">BEING A SEQUEL TO
THE STORY OF THE BOTTLE-CONJUROR</span>.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">On</span> my arrival in
town for the season, my eyes every where in the streets encountered a
phenomenon which I could not account for: namely, men walking in great
coats, the <span class = "smallroman">TAILS</span> of which were <span
class = "smallroman">CUT OFF</span> close to the body!&mdash;The first
person I met in this garb being rather of a mean appearance otherwise,
I&nbsp;set it down to the account of convenience, and recollected the
proverb of, <i>half a loaf being better than no bread</i>. But when I
saw numbers of gentlemen decorated with this <span class =
"smallroman">ABRIDGMENT</span> of a coat, many of whom to my personal
knowledge, could afford a whole coat, once a week if they chose,
I&nbsp;was totally at a loss to account for the grotesque appearance
they made. Surely, thought I, this cannot be voluntary.</p>

<p>On consulting, however, a friend, who always resides in the
metropolis and is a close observer of modes and manners, he solved all
my doubts.</p>

<p>“That absurd dress, which does not surprise you more than any other
stranger, is a wonderful proof of the obsequious servility of those who
would be thought <i>in the fashion</i>. Lord C. Spencer, from whom the
dress takes its name, bet with some friends that he would support a
fashion, the most useless and ridiculous that could be conceived; and
that it should, within a given time, be universally adopted. The bet
being laid he produced a pattern of this fashion, which excited so much
laughter, that his opponents were pretty confident he would lose his
bet. Lord C.’s opinion of mankind, was, however, better founded. The
fashion soon became general, and, to complete the <i>humbug</i>, the
wearers of this <i>half coat</i> have found out a thousand conveniencies
and advantages in it, such as saving of cloth, impossibility of being
draggled, easier put on, &amp;c. not one of which the author ever
thought of. Such is the origin of the Spencers! I&nbsp;need not remind
you that the bottle-conjuror affair was likewise a wager, to see what
lengths credulity would lead the public, and the present fashion is no
bad Second Part to that memorable take&nbsp;in.”</p>

<p>Are these things so, Mr. Editor? Are we really such fools as to adopt
a dress, the chief merit of which is its being ridiculous, and injurious
to trade? All I shall say is, Quis vult decipi decipitur!</p>

<h4>A DIGRESSION.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Many</span> of those
authors, who have largely contributed to the amusement and instruction
of readers, have considered episodes of digressions, a&nbsp;very
essential part of their labours. These writers seem apprehensive lest
the greedy reader should be surfeited with a repletion of highly
seasoned wit; and therefore occasionally serve up a course of more
homely fare. This practice, when the main subject of the work is
interesting and the writer sprightly, I&nbsp;always disapprove; but, if
the subject and writer are dull, I&nbsp;am constantly impatient for
digressions. The true style of digressing however has not frequently
been attained. Sterne attempted it with some success; but his marble
page, his crooked lines, and his seven castles are dull system, are dry
method, compared with the narrative of our modern peasantry. Having some
skill in stenography, I&nbsp;have been able to preserve one of those
diverting stories, which was not long since related in my hearing, and
which, for the improvement of speakers, as well as writers, I&nbsp;now
carefully transcribe.</p>

<p>“On the seventh day of last October, I will not however be positive
it was the seventh; it might possibly, for aught I know, be the eighth.
It could not be later than the eight nor earlier than the seventh. The
month if I mistake not, came in of a Saturday, and it must have been
very near the close of the first week; but the particular day is not
material. So, be that as it may, it is of no consequence; but, I&nbsp;am
pretty certain it was the seventh. I&nbsp;would not undertake for to go
for to swear to it; because I may possibly be mistaken; and, as I said
before, it is not material. If it was necessary, I&nbsp;should not be
much afraid to swear it was either the seventh or eighth. Indeed, the
more I think on it, the more I am convinced, in my own mind, that it was
the seventh. But, though I should not wish to swear to it, unless it was
necessary, I&nbsp;am as well persuaded of it, in my own mind, as I am of
any thing, that I do not know for certain. Well, as I was saying, on the
seventh of October last, for I am very sure it must be the seventh, one
of my neighbours; I&nbsp;call him a neighbour, though, it is true, he
does not live very near to me; perhaps seventy-five or eighty rods
distance. I&nbsp;do not know but it may be more. I&nbsp;very often
travel it, and possibly it appears to me shorter than it really is.
Indeed, I&nbsp;have not been used to have <i>near</i> neighbours. Before
he came, the nearest was at least half a mile from me; and, when this
one came, I&nbsp;told my wife, it seemed but a step to his house. But
that is neither here nor there. We are but new yet, and cannot expect to
have very near neighbours; but I had rather be as I be than have a
hundred such people for neighbours as I have sometimes been acquainted
with. But that is neither here nor there. But as
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page317" id = "page317">317</a></span>
I was saying, one of my neighbours came to my house. I&nbsp;had as lief
tell who it was as not. The matter I am certain will be known. It was
Noah <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘Doughlass’">Douglass</ins>. I&nbsp;was sitting before the fire. Before
it? I&nbsp;can’t say I was <i>exactly</i> before it. Perhaps I was a
little nearer one side than the other. But that is neither here nor
there. When he came in, I&nbsp;asked him to sit down, not thinking nor
mistrusting the least thing in the world. I&nbsp;had no more suspicion
of any difficulty with him than the farthest person upon earth. There
had always been a good correspond between us. He had always been
sociable with me, and I with him. We never had any quarrelling pro nor
con. We had had a good deal of deal together; but we were always very
authentic, and settled peaceably and quietly. But he had not been in the
house long, before I could see there was something that laboured. Well,
it was not longer than I have been telling the story, before he began.
Says Douglass, says he, don’t you think, says he, you have used me like
a rascal, says he. Why, Mr. Douglass, says I, if I was as stout a man as
you&mdash;And what if you <i>was</i>, says&nbsp;he.”</p>

<p>From this last reply of Douglass, I am persuaded he must be a lineal
descendant of the celebrated <span class = "smallcaps">Gawin
Douglass</span>, a very ancient English author, frequently quoted by
some of our modern grammarians, and considered as the true standard of

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Such</span> were the
plaintive accents that smote my ear, as I wandered, musing, by the banks
of the Mersey. The words had something in them which arrested my
attention; but the melancholy cadence with which they were sighed forth,
elicited the sympathetic tear of sorrow. I&nbsp;could not discover from
whom the ditty proceeded; I&nbsp;advanced, therefore, cautiously, to the
place whence the sounds issued, that I might view the distressed
mourner, who had already so powerfully engaged my commiseration.</p>

<p>She sat on the cold ground, under a shade of willows; distress spoke
in her countenance; the fountain of her tears appeared exhausted; and
her grief, unable to overflow and vent itself at her eyes, convulsed her
throbbing breast. Her form contained every thing that elegance and
beauty can
<span class = "pagenum">317b</span>
combine; her features were regular, and expressive; her eyes large and
black, but sorrow had robbed them of their vivid flashes; and her dress
was the remains of gentility.</p>

<p>I stood awhile in silent admiration; and was so enwrapt in the
contemplation of the fair distressed, that I had not hitherto noticed a
little dog, which she had in her lap, and viewed with all the tender
languishment of love. I&nbsp;was about to address her, when she again
began to sing&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“Fair truth and constancy shall prove</p>
<p>The pillars of Miranda’s love;</p>
<p>The main shall sooner float in air&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
</div>

<p>Here an involuntary sneeze, on my part, caused the unhappy maid, to
espy me, and break off her strains of woe.</p>

<p>She arose, and clasped her little care in her arms, tenderly but
deliciously exclaiming&mdash;“They shall not hurt thee, my Henry! these
murderers shall not come near thee! Rest on thy Miranda’s bosom, and
forget thy fears in her love!”</p>

<p>I approached nearer. She looked at me with earnestness; and saw the
big drop rolling down my cheeks, and my whole frame almost motionless
with grief. The delirium which she had just experienced immediately left
her: she advanced near me&mdash;“And do you pity me and my love?”</p>

<p>“Thou lovely fair one,” said I, “though I am unacquainted with thy
miseries, and the source from whence they flow; yet, let my tears
witness my heart felt commiseration<ins class = "correction" title =
"close quote missing">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“Is there, then, one soul left,” said she, “that feels for poor
Miranda; that feels for her father, and her lover?”</p>

<p>Here she sighed, and cast a tender look on her little companion.
A&nbsp;paleness overshadowed her cheeks, her lips quivered, and she
seemed about to relapse into her former delirium; when I diverted her
attention, by turning it to the beauty of the landscape, and the
serpentine windings of the river.</p>

<p>I offered my arm; which she accepted with that unsuspicious modesty,
that a heart pure and conscious of it’s innocence inspires. “Where do
you live Miranda?” said I. She started at hearing her name from a
stranger, having forgot that she had mentioned it; but, quickly
recollecting herself&mdash;“At the foot of yon farthest hill, you see
several clumps of trees around an humble cottage; at present,” replied
she, sighing, “I&nbsp;live, or rather die, there!” I&nbsp;desired leave,
to see her home: she thanked me for my kindness, and consented.</p>

<p>“Miranda,” said a grief-worn personage, whom, at our entrance into
the cot, I&nbsp;perceived laid on a poor but cleanly
couch&mdash;“Miranda, you shall not add to my heap of miseries by
staying in the fields so late; I&nbsp;am alarmed, at such times, for
your safety.”</p>

<p>At the sound of the voice, and at the appearance of the old lady,
I&nbsp;felt a tumultuous palpitation of the heart, and a more deeply
sympathizing sorrow, than I could account for.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page318" id = "page318">318</a></span>
She had not discovered me before: she now perceived me motionless at the
sight of this little mansion of sorrow. She alledged, in excuse for her
inattention to me, her solicitude for her daughter. A&nbsp;youth of
about twelve years old raised her up from the couch; a&nbsp;girl some
years older sat languidly at her feet. A&nbsp;little wood composed their
fire, which was at present their only light: it’s inconstant glimmerings
served only to exaggerate sights of woe.</p>

<p>Such were my <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for presentiments?">presentments</ins> on this occasion, that I
involuntarily conceived there must exist some unknown connection of
destiny or consanguinity between myself and the sufferers.
I&nbsp;therefore desired with eagerness, to be made acquainted with
their history.</p>

<p>On turning from Miranda, to whom I made this request, I beheld the
mother’s eyes fastened on me: a&nbsp;glistening tear impearled them: she
shook her head, as if disappointed, and poured forth a rending sigh.
Again my heart throbbed within my breast; but I <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘recollcted’">recollected</ins> the
desire I had expressed to Miranda, whom I perceived now composed, and
ready to satisfy my curiosity.</p>

<p>“The zeal, Sir, with which you appear to interest yourself in our
afflictions, entitles your request to attention. By complying, however,
I&nbsp;shall again pourtray in lively colours, to my own and my wretched
parent’s sight, those miseries which have by time acquired a mellower
tint. Hard is the fate of the inferior order of clergymen! How many are
the difficulties that surround them! The labourer, who by his toil is
able to support his family, enjoys comparatively the happiness of a
prince. The scanty pittance allowed them by the church, will oft times
scarcely procure food for themselves and their family. You will join
with us, no doubt, in lamenting, that in England, in this most happy and
heaven-favoured isle, there should exist so intolerable and just a
ground of complaint. Nay, even policy, one might imagine, would direct
them to abolish such a neglect of Christ’s ministers: for, as no
government can flourish, so it cannot long stand, without religion for
its basis. The common people chiefly respect externals, and fancy
themselves at liberty to deride the thread-bare coat, how great and how
many virtues soever its wearer may possess. When the expounders of
religion fall into disesteem, religion itself does not long escape;
till, at length, all laws, divine and human, are totally neglected and
despised. But, whither am I carried on? Excuse my wandering, Sir: such
considerations ever arise, when I reflect on our condition.”</p>

<p>“The justness of your remarks, Miss,” said I, “precludes the
necessity of an apology.”</p>

<p>“You, no doubt,” continued she, “conjecture, from what I have said,
that my father was a clergyman; your conjecture, Sir, is right. That
good man is one of the best and most neglected of the clerical
profession. He was thirty years curate of the neighbouring village;
where his name was ever heard with raptures, so long as he retained
<span class = "pagenum">318b</span>
the capacity of supplying their wants. But&mdash;O this ungrateful
world!&mdash;when he was no longer able to assist them, they thought
themselves freed from former obligations, and at liberty to laugh him to
scorn, and insult his misery!”</p>

<p>The old lady sighed; a tear started into her eye; she looked towards
Heaven, and was again calm.</p>

<p>“The widow, to whom he was a husband; the orphan, who had found in
him the tenderness of a father; were the first to aggravate his sorrows,
by that blackest of all vices, ingratitude. One only poor widow
exhibited a grateful heart&mdash;&mdash;But again I wander! His yearly
income was forty pounds, allowed him for doing the whole duty of the
church, by a rector whose laziness procured near two thousand. With this
small income we lived in happy frugality, many years: but the good man’s
heart overflowed with the milk of human kindness; and this scanty
pittance, though sufficient for our expences, and for small
beneficences, was very inadequate to the demands of wretchedness. He
borrowed, therefore, a&nbsp;sum of money, from a tradesman, to liberate
from prison one who craved his assistance. About this time, the son of
the rector returned from the university; a&nbsp;youth&mdash;Good
Heavens!&mdash;a youth whose form, whose mind, whose heart,

<h4 class = "smallcaps">Mrs. RADCLIFFE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">This</span> lady’s novels
have a bewitching interest. The power of painting the terrible and the
mysterious is hers, in an eminent degree, but her sketches of landscape,
though always indicating a skilful painter, are too numerous and minute.
They may be called the miniature pictures of nature. Whether in the
vales of Arno, or among the craggs of the Appennines, unsatisfied with
general description, she chooses to note every spire of grass, and every
shrub of the rocks. In the labyrinthian scenes of her castles and her
forests, the attentive critic may discern a degree of finesse and stage
trick, which, often repeated, offends, rather than surprises. When
curiosity pants to discover the secrets of a desolate chamber, or a
ruinated abbey, some, perhaps many, impediments may be judiciously
thrown in Fancy’s way. But the rusty and bloody key, the glimpse of
fancied apparitions, the perplexed path and the impracticable stair
case, occur so often in Mrs. Radcliffe’s midnight rambles, that they
soon lose their power of deception. But let pruning criticism lop what
it may, the laurels of this lady cannot be injured. Her style pure,
harmonious and forcible, might be a model, even to masculine writers. In
the exhibition of the nicer, and less obvious shades of character, she

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">By</span> all the nameless
sensations of tenderness, which ye whom heaven hath blessed with
children feel towards them, be entreated, then, to make their
improvement in piety and virtue their chief concern. That you should
provide as far as you are able for their comfortable support and happy
settlement in life, is undoubtedly your duty. Nor is it less your duty
to afford them every opportunity in your power for improving their
understandings, and laying up stores of useful and ornamental knowledge
in their minds. But, let it never be forgotten, that the principal part
of education, is the education of the heart. Endeavour by every method
in your power, to inspire them with a reverence for the Supreme Being,
with gratitude for his innumerable mercies; with a sence of honour and
love of virtue; with sentiments of generosity and compassion towards
their fellow creatures; with regard to truth; and with a consciousness
of the dignity and excellence of their rational nature. On this
foundation assist them in raising the superstructure of a manly,
virtuous and useful character. In a word, imitate the example of the
pious patriarch; and so command your children and houshold after you,
“that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and
judgment.”</p>
