<h4>A FUGITIVE THOUGHT.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Musing</span> the other day
in a pensive attitude, my head reclining on my hand, and my elbow
resting on the table&mdash;methought&mdash;Why is the mind either
incessantly haunted with gloom, or wrapt in extacy? Why is man generally
peevish, morose, sullen, fretful or passionate, and seldom enjoying that
beautiful equilibrium of temper that alone can produce happiness to
himself and others? The object of all (said I to myself) is to acquire
comfort and happiness; but how wide do they steer of the mark, that give
way to hateful passions. I&nbsp;recollected how trivial faults of
persons in my employ made me impatient&mdash;that I sometimes was
subject to those disagreeable emotions, and that I thereby made those
and myself unhappy: I&nbsp;bethought myself of recent trials, which,
though afflictive, should not have excited discontent; and I put up a
fervent petition to heaven, to assist me in a resolution I then formed
of never giving way to chagrin, but of always endeavouring to possess,
at least, a&nbsp;pleasing equanimity. I&nbsp;am no enemy to transports
of joy, when not carried to excess: I&nbsp;fancy, that for this end are
the passions given us; but we have perverted into a source of uneasiness
what was designed to increase our pleasure, and to make this life of
probation less burthensome.</p>

<p>I will, continued I, from this, endeavour to be as happy myself as
possible, and it shall be my care to cause those around me, as far as
lies in my power, to participate in my bliss. My domestics, and all
under my care, shall be but gently reproved when they err; or rather,
I&nbsp;will acquaint them merely with their faults, and if they are wise
they surely will improve. My children I will advise with the utmost
tenderness, and use every art to allure them into the paths of virtue;
good shall be represented to them in the most glowing and fascinating
colours, and vice shall be depicted with the most frightful, hideous and
forbidding appearance. My wife, the partner of my joys, must be the
partaker of my happiness&mdash;hand in hand shall we go on in this
blissful path&mdash;no jar shall disturb our harmony, nor shall
discontent or anger ever wrinkle our brows: then shall we fulfil the
design of our Maker in sending us into the
<span class = "pagenum">321b</span>
world, and shall pass through its variegated scenes with as much comfort
and content as can possibly be enjoyed here below by mortals.</p>

<p class = "right">N. L.</p>


<p class = "twin w16">&nbsp;</p>

<h4>DISCONTENT.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> the humble and
seemingly-quiet shade of private life, as well as among the great and
mighty, discontent broods over its imaginary sorrows; preys upon the
citizen no less than the courtier, and often nourishes passions equally
malignant in the cottage and in the palace. Having once seized the mind,
it spreads its own gloom over every surrounding object; it every where
searches out materials for itself; and in no direction more frequently
employs its unhappy activity, than in creating divisions among mankind,
and in magnifying slight provocations into mortal injuries.</p>

<p>In situations where much comfort might be enjoyed, this man’s
superiority and that man’s neglect, our jealousy of a friend, our hatred
of a rival, an imagined affront, or a mistaken point of honour, allow us
no repose. Hence discord in families, animosities among friends, and
wars among nations! Look around us! every where we find a busy
multitude. Restless and uneasy in their present situation, they are
incessantly employed in accomplishing a change of it; and as soon as
their wish is fulfilled, we discern, by their behaviour, that they are
as dissatisfied as they were before. Where they expected to have found a
paradise, they find a desert.</p>

<p>The man of business pines for leisure; the leisure for which he had
longed proves an irksome gloom, and, through want of employment, he
languishes, sickens, and dies.</p>

<p>The man of retirement fancies no state so happy as that of active
life; but he has not engaged long in the tumults and contests of the
world, until he finds cause to look back with regret on the calm hours
of his former privacy and retreat.</p>

<p>Beauty, wit, eloquence and fame, are eagerly desired by persons in
every rank of life. They are the parent’s fondest wish for his child;
the ambition of the young, and the admiration of the old; and yet in
what numberless instances have they proved, to those who possessed them,
no other than shining snares, seductions to vice, instigations to folly,
and, in the end, sources of misery.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> King proposed in
the council of state in which this decree was debated, that some of the
criminals should be executed, but the rest imprisoned for life. The
Marquis of **ira insisted, however, upon the execution of the legal
punishment, and was seconded by the other members. The King mitigated
the punishment of those who had been sentenced to be hanged, ordering
them to be beheaded. The two prelates, whose fate had been left to his
Royal pleasure, were doomed to eternal imprisonment.</p>

<p>Going to Court the next day, I heard Alumbrado had found means to
escape from his prison. It was believed Oliv*rez had bribed the gaoler
by a large sum to suffer him to liberate himself, which appeared to me
very probable, as the latter could be found no where, and very likely
had joined the villain in his flight, who, however, as it is to be
wished for the best of human kind, will not escape the punishment due to
his crimes<a class = "plain" name = "tag322" id = "tag322" href =
"#note322">*</a>.</p>

<p>What I am going to relate now, is the account of an eye-witness, for
how could I have been present on such an heart-breaking occasion?</p>

<p>On the 28th of August a scaffold, covered with black cloth, was
erected before the house where the prisoners had been confined the
preceding night. On this scaffold three steps were seen, on each of
which a chair was placed, the upper one for the Duke of Cam*na, the
middle chair for the Marquis of Villa R*al, and the lower one for the
Duke of Ar*amar.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Villa R*al was the first who stepped out of one of the
windows of the house, which served instead of a door. He begged the
bye-standers pardon in a short speech, and was beheaded.</p>

<p>As soon as his corpse was covered, his son made his appearance. His
pale and staring countenance resembled that of a corpse. He uttered not
a syllable, seated himself on the chair, and one blow severed his head
from his body.</p>

<p>The pen drops from my hand, and the idea of that horrid scene curdles
the blood in my veins. Reader, who art perusing these pages, look back
once more on the road on which a noble young man, adorned with the most
excellent
<span class = "pagenum">322b</span>
genius, and the best of hearts, suffered himself to be seduced to a
crime for which he atoned with his life!</p>

<div class = "footnote">
<p><a name = "note322" id = "note322" href = "#tag322">*</a>
He did not escape the vengeance of Heaven if, as I have reason to
suppose, Alumbrado is the same person with Vi*o*va. The latter fled from
Port**al to Spa*n, deceived the Minister through his pretended occult
knowledge, and continued to be connected with him after he had been
removed from the helm of government. However, a&nbsp;journey which
Alumbrado made to Tol**o, where he attempted to play off his magical
delusions, brought on his destruction; he was seized by the officers of
the Inquisition, and executed as a heretic and sorcerer. Oli*arez too
was arrested by the Inquisition, when that ruthless tribunal was
informed of his connection with the villainous Alumbrado: his relations
are, however, believed to have dispatched him by poison, in order to
spare him the disgrace of a public execution.</p>

<h5>CONTINUATION.</h5>

<p class = "center smaller">
(<i>By an unknown Hand.</i>)</p>

<p>The Marquis of F*, to whom the preceding Memoirs had been entrusted
for publication, dying nine weeks after the execution of his unhappy
friend, left these interesting papers to me, after I had promised him on
his death-bed to execute the last request of their ill-fated author.
I&nbsp;have discharged the trust reposed in me some years since, and the
character of the poor deluded young man has been vindicated in the eyes
of the public, who have received the mournful tale of his misfortunes
with tears of pity. The continuation of these extraordinary Memoirs,
which I am going to add, is so wonderful and remarkable, that I wish it
had been in my power to communicate it to the public along with the
rest; the whole being, however, a&nbsp;secret of state, which I am not
allowed to disclose while the persons concerned in it are alive,
I&nbsp;shall, perhaps, be obliged to leave the publication of the
subsequent pages to my children.</p>

<p>Nine years are already elapsed since the execution of the
conspirators, and the death of the Marquis of F* and&mdash;the Duke of
Ca*ina, whose hapless fate the latter has bewailed in silent grief, and
who generally is believed to have been executed with the rest of his
associates, is yet alive.</p>

<p>The King, who ardently wished to spare the life of the Duke, but at
the same time was afraid of counteracting the decree of the council of
state, who had doomed him to public execution, found himself in no small
embarrassment. However, the Irishman, who wished with equal ardour to
save the life of the poor misguided young man, soon found out means of
dissolving the Gordian knot. “I&nbsp;could,” said he to the King, “make
a mask, which no one should be able to discern from the real phisiognomy
of the Duke; and this mask I could fasten to the face of some other
person, in such a manner, that every one should believe that person to
be the Duke. If, therefore, we can find a person who resembles him in
size, and in the make of his body, and at the same time shall be willing
to lose his head in the place of the Duke, it will not be difficult to
save the life of the latter, without either offending the Senate, or
leaving him at liberty to conspire a second time against the life of
your Majesty. This person, who in every respect will answer our purpose,
is <i>Alumbrado</i>. He is of the same size with the Duke, and if
informed that he is condemned to be torn by horses, will not refuse to
accept the mask, and to die by the sword in the place of the Duke. In
order to cover this innocent fraud, we must give out that Alumbrado has
escaped from the prison, and thus the benevolent wish of your Majesty
can be accomplished with secrecy and safety.”</p>

<p>This plan of the Irishman was executed with the privity and
assistance of only a few persons, who took a solemn oath never to
disclose the secret, and Alumbrado was beheaded in the room of the Duke.
The deceit was carried
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page323" id = "page323">323</a></span>
on so dexterously, that none of those who witnessed his execution,
suspected him to be any other person but the Duke whom he
represented.</p>

<p>The latter, however, knew nothing of this fraud that had been
practised in his favour, for although the Irishman had modelled his face
in wax, yet he had not received the most distant hint of the purpose for
which it had been done. When he was carried out of his dungeon,
a&nbsp;few hours after the execution of his father and the disguised
Alumbrado, and led through a dark subterraneous passage, he fancied that
he was to meet his doom. He was conducted over many secret staircases,
and at length entered, through an iron door, a&nbsp;dark apartment where
he was ordered to wait. But soon after a second door was opened, and an
apartment illuminated with numberless torches presented itself to his
view. There he beheld the King sitting at a table, and a man with a sack
and a sword standing by his side, who beckoned to him to step nearer.
The Duke having entered the apartment, the door was bolted after him,
and he expected every moment to be his last. The King looked at him for
some time without speaking a word, and at last began:&mdash;“You have
designed the ruin of your country, and conspired against my life, what
do you think you deserve?” “Death!” the Duke replied. “You have been
doomed by the Council of State to suffer a very painful death;
I&nbsp;have, however, mitigated their sentence into that of your being
executed by the sword.” The Duke thanked the King for his clemency, and
looked at the man, whom he mistook for the executioner. “Your sentence
has been executed already!” the King resumed, after a long pause of
awful expectation. The silence of the Duke, and the expression of his
features, bespoke his desire for an explanation of these mysterious
words. “You gaze at me;” the King added, “you doubt, perhaps, the truth
of what I have said? however you shall soon be convinced.” So saying he
made a signal to the man who was standing by his side, upon which the
latter opened the sack, and taking out a head recently cut off, showed
it to the Duke, who staggered back when he discerned his own features in
the face of the bleeding head. The whole mystery was now explained to
him, and the King added: “You owe your life to my mercy and the
invention of the Irishman; it is, however, not in my power to restore
you to human society. Although you are alive, yet you will be numbered
among the dead, and be lost to the world for ever. You will pass your
life banished from society, and deprived of liberty, yet you may rest
assured that none of the comforts of life, liberty excepted, will be
denied you.”</p>

<p>This sentence was executed literally, the Duke was confined for the
rest of his life in a strong tower situated on the river Ta*o, where
handsome apartments were allotted to him, and wanted nothing but
liberty.</p>

fills an important office in this State, was travelling through a part
of the country where he was not so personally known as his horses and
carriage; having exchanged places with his servant who attended on
horseback, he fell into conversation with a rough countryman, who was
riding the same way, and from the gentleman’s extraordinary paleness,
mistook him for the servant. The conversation turning on the fineness of
the horses before the carriage, the clown observed, that he knew them
very well; they belonged to Mr. <span class = "locked">G&mdash;</span>:
the gentleman replied they did: “And I suppose,” said the fellow, “that

The following story struck me on perusal, as an affecting one. Modern
military <i>petit maitres</i>, who have never seen any other service but
that of the ladies, pique themselves on extreme <i>insensibility</i>.
They nightly infest the theatres, not to be entertained, but to
interrupt&mdash;to display white teeth and empty heads&mdash;to laugh at
every noble sentiment of Melpomene, though delivered with all the
exquisite energy of a Siddons, or the delicate tenderness of a
Merry&mdash;to such <i>beings</i> this little story may be of infinite
use&mdash;they may learn that <i>sensibility</i> does not entirely
disgrace regimentals, and that the <i>sympathetic tear</i> may be given
to distress, without tarnishing the honour of the soldier.</p>

<h4 class = "smallcaps">The FATAL EFFECTS of a TOO SUSCEPTIBLE HEART<br>
in a YOUNG PRUSSIAN OFFICER.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“My</span> son was an
ensign in a regiment in which I ranked as Captain. We had served two
campaigns together, and I was pleased with the marks of a cool and
sensible courage, which I had observed in him, and which promised the
most flattering hopes of his becoming one day an ornament to his
family.</p>

<p>“His heart was naturally generous and tender. This virtue endeared
him to me; but I trembled for its effects. It might, I&nbsp;thought,
shake his fortitude in the trying scenes of the miserable spectacles of
war, and possibly suppress the enterprising spirit of youth;
a&nbsp;quality so essential to the advancement of a soldier, and so
necessary an embellishment to his character.</p>

<p>“Oftentimes, when his overflowing compassionate heart would vent
itself in a burst of sorrow for the unfortunate, I&nbsp;had recourse to
the <i>sophistry</i> of argument, to paint those objects of his
reflections in different colours to his imagination; and while reproving
him with his unmanly weakness, could have clasped him to my bosom for
the melting tenderness of his nature.</p>

<p>“I frequently, though with utter repugnance, conducted him to the
trying scenes of suffering criminals; thus attempting to familiarize his
mind to the disastrous events which life is too often embittered
with.</p>

<p>“Some little time after the affair of Schweidnitz, our army had burnt
and sacked a small village of the Austrians. It was our chance of duty
to be sent to this place. When the general confusion of the day had
subsided, and some order restored among the troops, we made an excursion
round the village to view the effects.</p>

<p>“On our approach to the ruins of a once clean and neat house, we were
suddenly shocked by the approach of an old woman. The genius of extreme
wretchedness seemed faithfully pourtrayed in her ghastly
countenance.</p>

<p>“She flung herself upon her knees, and in a shrill voice of
desperation, imprecated the most direful curses on our heads. “If,” says
she, “you call yourselves men, and not savages of unequalled brutality,
either kill me instantly, and end my extreme sufferings; or, O! let me
have help to search for the remains of my children.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">324b</span>
<p>“I tenderly exhorted her to calm herself&mdash;that she might expect
every assistance; and staying with her till my son had returned with a
few soldiers, I&nbsp;learnt, that on the alarm of the sudden approach of
our troops to the village, the unrestrained disorder which was naturally
to be expected, had forced her son and daughter, with two grandchildren,
to seek shelter in a cellar of the house; which house sharing the same
unfortunate fate with the rest, was soon pillaged and set on
fire&mdash;that she herself had fled some little way into the country,
and had retired from the danger of the enemy, in hopes that, in case of
a discovery, her age might secure her from that fate which her
grandchildren, two young women in the bloom of life, might otherwise be
exposed to&mdash;that their father, who was a notary of the place, with
his wife, had resolved on staying with the children in their
concealment.</p>

<p>“When my son returned with the soldiers, the old woman showed us the
spot where we should search for the poor devoted family. We had not been
long at work among the ruins, when we broke into the cellar whither the
family had fled. Here a scene presented itself, that would have turned a
monarch’s heart from the fell tide of war, which brings such desolation
and horror in its course.</p>

<p>“Clasped in each others arms lay two beautiful sisters, with their
father and mother by their side, suffocated by the smoke; while the old
woman, with horrid yells, was bewailing the loss of her unfortunate
children, kissing the bodies, and frantic with grief. My son stood with
folded arms musing over this melancholy spectacle.</p>

<p>“I solicited him to depart; I urged him to withdraw from so affecting
a scene. Sternly did he turn his eyes on me, and seemed petrified to the
spot. In vain did I reason on the necessary consequences of war; that it
was no premeditated cruelty, but one of those casual misfortunes that
even the civil transactions of life are often checquered with.</p>

<p>“Where is your reason, your manhood, my boy? shall a soldier be
overcome with weak womanish feelings? for shame! for shame! All men in
the course of their lives must make up their minds to calamities like
these. Away! Your countrymen will ridicule your want of firmness; and
the laurels which you have hitherto acquired, will only serve to point
you out as a more conspicuous instance of effeminacy.</p>

<p>“I took him by the arm to draw him gently from this distressing
sight, when he flung himself away from me, and exclaimed, pointing to
the youngest of the girls, whose tongue, from the convulsive gasps of
death, hung from her mouth, “Behold this unparalleled butchery of my

profession! Hell only has invented thee. From this moment I abjure thee.
I&nbsp;will not return to these blood-hounds: I&nbsp;will fly to the

there! my father,” pointing again to the dead bodies, and burst into a
flood of tears.</p>

<p>“It required some force to bear him from this calamitous scene; and
so strong was the impression, that a fixed melancholy took entire
possession of him: and such was the extreme delicacy and tenderness of
his feelings, that I was destined to see this beloved child seized with
a violent fever, and to hear him, in the paroxisms of his distemper,
rave in the wildest, yet most pathetic language on this event.</p>

<p>“Some little time before he expired, he had fashioned one of the
young women into his wife; and starting up in bed, cursing the war which
had snatched her away from him, he fixed his eyes ghastly upon me, which
I readily translated into a remonstrance for being the author of his
unhappy malady, fell back into a swoon, from which he never
recovered.”</p>

<h4>MIRANDA.</h4>

<p class = "center smallest extended">A MORAL TALE.</p>

<p class = "center smaller">
(Concluded from <a href = "nos80_92.html#page318">page 318</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Sighs</span> and tears
interrupted her speech; her words died on her tongue; she pressed her
little companion, and was silent. Her mother begged she might here take
up the story.</p>

<p>She was just beginning, when an old woman opened the cottage-door.
Her appearance was such as to prejudice beholders in her favour. She set
down a basket, which she carried on her arm; and, without speaking a
word, was about to retire, when the matron called to her&mdash;“This
gentleman, Mary, who deigns to interest himself so much in our
afflictions, will not, my heart, I&nbsp;know not why, tells me, be
offended at your being admitted to his company.” I&nbsp;joined my voice
to the old lady’s&mdash;Mary curtsied, and sat down.</p>

<p>“This, Sir,” continued the old lady; “this, Sir, is our Heaven-sent
benefactress: under that rustic garb, are virtues which would adorn the
possessors of a throne!&mdash;But I make you uneasy, my good friend;
I&nbsp;will cease to praise you in words: I&nbsp;will only tell your
actions, and let them praise you. This worthy creature, Sir, lived with
us twenty years. In that space, she saved nearly forty pounds; by which
we have all, my poor dear husband included, been for these nine months
supported.”</p>

<p>“The money came from you, my good lady; it was my duty, therefore,”
said Mary, “when you stood in need, to restore it to you again.”</p>

<p>“Her attentions, Sir, would heal our woes, if they could admit of
cure: but, alas! that seems impossible. However, when I reflect how
miraculously Heaven has hitherto preserved us, I&nbsp;take comfort; and
hope that, in his own good time and manner, he will make us triumph over
our calamities. God is just; he chastens those whom he receives into the
number of his children.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">325b</span>
<p>“Do not doubt, Madam,” exclaimed I, involuntarily clasping her hand;
“do not doubt, that God will speedily cause you to emerge out of this
sea of adversity!”</p>

<p>“Will you please, Madam, to take your little supper now?” said Mary,
with officious attention.</p>

<p>“We will,” replied her mistress; “and this gentleman, if he can put
up with our rustic food, will perhaps do us the honour to partake
with&nbsp;us.”</p>

<p>We moved to the table; and, when supper was over, the old lady
returned the clue of the narrative&mdash;</p>

<p>“Henry, the rector’s amiable son, returned now from Oxford; he saw,
he admired, he loved Miranda. The nobleness of his nature caused him to
act in every thing with the strictest honour and integrity. He confessed
his passion, and received as ingenious reciprocation of love. With
generous frankness, he acquainted his father with his attachments. The
haughty priest foamed with rage at the bare mention of it, and maddened
at the idea of his son’s marrying<span class = "locked">---</span>these
were his words<span class = "locked">---</span>“a wench without fortune,
family, or any thing; the daughter of my curate, too!” In short, from
hence forward, he studied only how to distress and ruin us. His first
motion was to get his son out of the way, whom he compelled to take the
tour of Europe!<span class = "locked">---</span>Miranda sobbed
aloud&mdash;“a joyless tour, alas! for Henry.” We believe he constantly
writes to Miranda; but the rector secures his letters, knowing that we
are not able to bring him to account. Not satisfied with having
separated the lovers, he sought for other means of distressing us; and,
having bought the debt which my husband had contracted, thrust him with
merciless cruelty into prison. Here we succour him, and make him as
comfortable as such a situation will allow: though the surly priest
takes every means of harrassing both him and&nbsp;us.”</p>

<p>When the old lady had finished her narrative, I felt such deep
commiseration, that I could answer her only by marks of indignation, and
by sighs.</p>

<p>Miranda, during the whole time, had been totally absorbed in tears:
but, now, collecting herself, she caught my eyes fixed on the little
dog. “You wonder,” said she, “no doubt, at the unusual kindness which I
manifest towards this little animal. I&nbsp;will put an end to your
astonishment. It is the only memorial of my Henry; he gave it to me: we
were both wont to amuse ourselves with it; since his departure I have
cherished it in my bosom; it has eat of my bread, drank of my cup, and
been to me as my lover.”</p>

<p>I thanked her for her condescension; and, turning to address the old
lady, found her eyes again fastened on me: she examined my features
involuntarily, and with seeming forgetfulness; then shook her head as
before, and sighed. This striking behaviour, particularly as I found
myself similarly circumstanced, stopped what I was about to utter.
I&nbsp;was silent. Soon after, she looked eagerly at me again.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Sir; I am sensible of my rudeness, but nature impels me
to this behaviour; will you have the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page326" id = "page326">326</a></span>
goodness to ease my doubts, by informing me, whether you are a native of
England?”</p>

<p>“No, Madam! but born of English parents in Russia.”</p>

<p>“Good Heaven! art thou, then, making me amends for the afflictions
thou hast laid upon&nbsp;me!”</p>

<p>“Your words, Madam, distract me! What do they mean? My heart tells me
that some kindred tie binds us. Heaven grant that it may
be&nbsp;so!”</p>

<p>“Is your name, then, Egerton?”---“The same.”</p>

<p>“I thank thee, O God!”---Here she sunk into a swoon; but was quickly
recovered by her daughter and the old servant.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes again; and, by the kindness of indulgent Heaven,
I&nbsp;embraced a long-lost-sister! Who can describe my joy?</p>

<p>Our family thought she had become a prey to the waves. She had been
shipwrecked, at an early age, in a vessel bound to England; was taken up
by an English privateer, and adopted as the captain’s daughter. About
the time she married, the captain had been unfortunate; and had,
therefore, no portion but about two hundred pounds to give with her,
which sum had been long since expended in the education of her children.
He promised, however, to seek out her parents, but was cast away in the
voyage. She, therefore, had never heard any thing of them; and, as the
captain of the vessel in which herself had been wrecked had her
instructions in his possession, she knew not whither she was intended to
go to, in England.</p>

<p>Miranda, and her sister, now pressed me to take their bed for the
night, as it was too late to return; but, as I was stronger, and in
better health than them, I&nbsp;insisted on using the couch.</p>

<p>Early next morning, I repaired to Lord Alton, my worthy host, and
acquainted him with my adventure. He hastened with me to relieve my
respected, but unknown brother, from the horrors of confinement.</p>

<p>We reached the prison; when, lo! the good man had just been liberated
by his future son. Henry had returned in disguise; had discharged the
debt; and was now receiving his grateful benediction. I&nbsp;explained
who I was: and they received me with tears of joy.</p>

<p>His lordship took upon himself the conciliation of the rector, and
immediately set out to acquaint him with all the circumstances, while we
hastened to the cot. I&nbsp;will not attempt to describe the overflowing
joy of the old couple, nor the rapturous embraces of the young folks.
Miranda underwent a transient suspension of her faculties, but awakened
to never-fading happiness. The two young children climbed the good man’s
knees, to share the long-regretted kiss. The old woman gazed on her
worthy master, with eyes overflowing with unaffected tears of mingled
joy and sorrow. Her extacy was unbounded; she lifted up her hands to
Heaven, and silently blessed its goodness! Her master did not neglect
her, but quickly received her in a kind and grateful embrace.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">326b</span>
<p>We now received a message from his lordship, desiring our attendance
immediately. Henry, the worthy curate, and myself, quickly obeyed it. We
met the hitherto obdurate father&mdash;but, how changed! He was all
politeness, all compliance: proud of an alliance with his lordship’s
friend and relation&mdash;for such Miranda now proved to be. I&nbsp;gave
my niece a dower equal to the young man’s fortune.</p>

<p>In a few days the nuptials were celebrated. All the inhabitants of
the village shared heartily in their joy. They danced on the village
green, and were treated in rustic sumptuousness by the happy bridegroom.
Whispers of blessings showered on them both! Such as had been ungrateful
to the father, threw themselves on their knees, and asked his
forgiveness; which was readily granted them, with a kind and gentle
rebuke. Even the rector sued for pardon, ashamed of his inhuman
treatment, as he himself termed&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>His lordship soon after stationed my brother in a comfortable
rectory, to which I added five hundred pounds a year as my sister’s
fortune.</p>

<p>The old woman survived but a few months: during which time she had
been treated as a sister. Her remains were interred in a vault designed
for the family; and a small mural monument was erected with this
inscription&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry, and his ever-lovely Miranda, live in tempered extacies of
love; their little dog is treated as a child. They have one child,

are to inherit my estates, as worthy and as virtuous as their

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> sun was retiring
behind a lofty ridge of mountains to gladden other regions; the towering
spires of the village churches were tipt with gold; while the
resplendent rays reflected from the windows dazzled the eye. Above was
the azure vault, variegated with fleecy clouds; beneath was Nature’s
verdant carpet. The little songsters of the grove were paying their
tributes of praise in melodious strains; the bleatings of the lambs, and
the lowings of the milky mothers re-echoed from the vallies. The waters
of a gently murmuring stream, which ran by the foot of a mountain, were
silvered o’er by the mild rays of the queen of night. The soothing sound
of a distant cataract gently saluted the ear. The fragrant odors of
flowers, watered by gentle zephyrs, breath’d a delightful perfume.</p>

<p>Surely, says <span class = "smallcaps">Amelia</span>, all nature
conspires to calm the mind, to restore tranquility, to soften every
care. But what can ease the torture of a love-sick soul; like the angry
sea after agitation by blustering winds, ’tis still tumultuous. My <span

king of terrors he has fallen an untimely prey: cold are the clods that
cover his once faithful breast. That heart which was once the seat of
sensibility, and endowed with every virtue, ceases to vibrate to the
sound of woe. The widow and the orphan shall point to thy tomb, <span
class = "smallcaps">Philander</span>, and cry, There lies our friend and
patron! She walked pensively towards the place where his last remains
were interred: Is this white stone, emblem of his innocence, the only
<i>memento</i> of the lovely youth?&mdash;No&mdash;thou ever livest in
the soul of <span class = "smallcaps">Amelia</span>; there, in indelible
characters, thy image is impress’d. I&nbsp;will strew thy grave with
flowers; I&nbsp;will raise upon it the green sod; I&nbsp;will encircle
it with willows. Let not unhallowed feet tread here; this place to love
is sacred. Nightly will I visit thy grave, nor shall the wealth of
worlds induce me to forego the mournful pleasure. If the spirits of the
just watch round their surviving friends, then surely thou art my
guardian angel. Dear shade, thou knowest the anguish of my soul: to me
thou can’st not be visible&mdash;where thou art, I&nbsp;soon shall be,
never to part again: in that state, where eternal love, and joy, and
peace prevail. While she stood entranced in pleasing anticipation, she
reflected on his last request:&mdash;“<span class =
"smallcaps">Amelia</span>, live to reward my virtues, friend, and bless
the world
<span class = "pagenum">327b</span>
with a race of angels like thyself.” Suddenly she started at the voice
of complaining and of woe;&mdash;’twas <span class =
"smallcaps">Titius</span>, breathing the anguish of his soul to the
silent night.&mdash;“Oh, <span class = "smallcaps">Amelia</span>, thou
lovely fair one, how long must I mourn an unreturned affection? thou
knowest I waste my midnight hours in thoughts on thee; the conscious
moon, the woods, the groves, are witnesses of my love: I&nbsp;grieve
unpitied&mdash;I sigh unheard.” As he advanced towards her, she
exclaimed:&mdash;“<span class = "smallcaps">Titius</span>, I know,
I&nbsp;feel thy sorrow;&mdash;if thou can’st in return for love accept
of friendship, I&nbsp;am thine. Thou knowest the object of my soul, the
once adorable, amiable <span class = "smallcaps">Philander</span>.” In
an extacy of amazement and delight, he cries&mdash;“Angels, catch the
sounds; ’tis my <span class = "smallcaps">Amelia</span>’s voice: thy
friendship is more valuable than the love of <span class =
"smallcaps">Titius</span>. Let us be happy. We will visit the grave of
<span class = "smallcaps">Philander</span> together, and pay to his
memory the tribute of love and friendship. Each returning season we will
decorate his grave with flowers, till we go to join him in the world of
spirits; where there is an ever blooming spring, an eternal day.”</p>

<h4>CHEARFULNESS.</h4>

<hr class = "w075">

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“Come, Chearfulness, triumphant fair,</p>
<p>Shine thro’ the painful cloud of care:</p>
<p>O sweet of language, mild of mien;</p>
<p>O virtue’s friend, and pleasure’s queen!</p>
<p>And, while thy gracious gifts I feel,</p>
<p>My song shall all thy praise reveal.”</p>

<p class = "right">Dr. <span class = "smallcaps">Akenside</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">It</span> is the
indispensable duty, not to say privilege, of every rational being on the
face of the earth, to cultivate and improve a serene and chearful
disposition, independent of that levity and versatility which many
possess from an erroneous way of thinking. “Chearfulness,” says Mr.
Addison, in the Spectator&mdash;a work of very considerable merit for
its natural sweetness, ease, and delicacy&mdash;“is the best promoter of
health. Repinings and secret murmurings of heart give imperceptible
strokes to those delicate fibres of which the vital parts are composed,
and wear out the machine insensibly; not to mention those violent
ferments which they stir up in the blood, and those irregular, disturbed
motions, which they raise in the animal spirits. The pleasures of
friendship, books, conversation, and other accidental diversions of
life, offer themselves as incitements to a chearful temper, to persons
of all ranks and conditions; and which may sufficiently shew us, that
Providence did not design this world should be filled with murmurs and
repinings, or that the heart of man should be involved in gloom and
melancholy.”</p>

<p>There are many persons who indulge a fixed melancholy, from religious
motives. Many of the lower orders of society contract a gloomy,
forbidding aspect, by feeding their minds with the ranting effusions of
puritanical enthusiasts; whose doctrines, for the most part, are
particularly calculated to cloud all their bright intellects. They
discourage the good, and intimidate the penitent. They oftener disserve,
than benefit, the cause of christianity. It is an observation of the
learned and pious Dr. Watts, that religion never was designed to make
our pleasures less. Innocent recreations (and innocent they must be, or
not at all) calculated to promote chearfulness, are absolutely necessary
to soften the cares of life. Superstition and fanaticism are highly
incompatible
<span class = "pagenum">329b</span>
with the generous feelings of a devotional taste and habit which are in
themselves very desirable; but a habit of melancholy is altogether
improper, and wholly repugnant to these divine precepts, which ought to
influence all to the adoption of amiable principles, and a chearful
disposition. “Piety and goodness,” says Dr. Blair, “ought never to be
marked with that dejection which sometimes takes rise from superstition,
but which is the proper portion only of guilt. At the same time, the
chearfulness belonging to virtue, is to be carefully distinguished from
that light and giddy temper which characterises folly, and is so often
found among the dissipated and vicious part of mankind. Their gaiety is
owing to a total want of reflection; and brings with it the usual
consequences of an unthinking habit, shame, remorse, and heaviness of
heart, in the end. The chearfulness of a well regulated mind, springs
from a good conscience and the favour of Heaven, and is bounded by
temperance and reason. It makes a man happy in himself, and promotes the
happiness of all around him. It is the clear and calm sunshine of a mind
illuminated by piety and virtue. It crowns all other good dispositions,
and comprehends the general effect which they ought to produce on the
heart.”</p>

<p>Indeed, true piety is an invaluable treasure; and happy are they who
esteem its salutary tendency. It meleorates the morals and disposition,
and promotes present and future felicity. It adds dignity, pleasure, and
security, to any age. To old age, in particular, it is the most becoming
grace, the most substantial support, and the sweetest comfort. It is the
only proper and adequate relief of decaying man. Let the old and the
young, therefore, who wish to be happy, and preserve so great an
acquisition, cultivate it with peculiar care and increasing ardour, as
the source of all tranquility and chearfulness; and let it be
remembered, that in order to retain it successfully, the whole tenour of
life must be guided and attended by the very admirable requisites of
temperance, innocence, and simplicity.</p>

<p>A chearful temper irradiates the progress of life, and dispels the
evils of sublunary nature. All, indeed, cannot possess so desirable a
blessing, without some interruptions, inseparable from the evils of
life, to damp its energy and excellence. Afflictions are so diversified,
that it were superfluous to enumerate even the most prominent and
lamentable:
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page330" id = "page330">330</a></span>
but in these, and all other misfortunes, there is a remedy pointed out
for the acceptance of mankind, which, if properly administered, does not
fail to alleviate the unavoidable casualties and afflictions necessarily
attendant on frail nature. Not a few are rendered wretched and
despondent by their own immediate vices, after having exhausted their
vile pursuits and prostituted their advancement to a comfortable and
peaceful life by practices which religion forbids and wisdom reprobates.
We should endeavour to turn our enjoyments to a current altogether
serene and pure. Such rational and manly conduct would render us
respectable: man would admire a life so exemplary, and God himself would
approve&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>I was pleased a few evenings since, on reading the answer of an
Italian Bishop, who possessed all the virtues which adorn and embellish
human life. He struggled through great difficulties without repining;
and met with much opposition in the discharge of his episcopal function,
without ever betraying the smallest impatience. An intimate friend, who
highly admired these virtues which he thought it impossible to imitate,
one day asked the prelate if he could communicate the <i>secret</i> of
being always easy?&mdash;“Yes,” replied the old man, “I&nbsp;can teach
you <i>my</i> secret, and with great facility: it consists in nothing
more than making a right use of my <i>eyes</i>.”</p>

<p>My friend begged him to explain himself. “Most willingly,” returned
the Bishop&mdash;“In whatever state I am, I&nbsp;first of all look up to
heaven, and I remember that my principal business here, is to get there:
I&nbsp;then look down upon the earth, and call to mind how small a space
I shall occupy in it when I come to be interred: I&nbsp;then look abroad
into the world, and observe what multitudes there are, who in many
respects are more unhappy than myself. Thus I learn where true happiness
and innate chearfulness are placed, where all my cares must end, and hew
very little reason I have to repine, or to complain.”</p>

<p>From what has been said, we may learn to be chearful; at least, calm
and contented; and gratefully enjoy, in moderation, the blessings which
Providence has bestowed on us. It is puerile and absurd, to indulge
melancholy. Be it, therefore, the endeavour of us all to cherish with
the greatest care an ingenuous and mild disposition; and, above all,
religion, piety, and virtue. Let it be our constant rule and practice to
cultivate self-command; to cultivate humility; to cultivate the milder
affections; submit to our reason and our conscience; be christians, and
be happy.</p>

<p><i>That Order is the Supreme Law of Nature</i>. The motion of the
celestial bodies, the ecliptical course of our globe, the regular change
of day and night, and of the different seasons, and every object we
behold in Nature’s boundless realms, enforce the truth of that principle
on the mind of the attentive observer. We no where behold effects
without a sufficient cause, no where causes without proportionate
effects; no where vacancies nor irregular leaps in the series and
concatenation of things; no where beings that are insulated and unallied
to the whole; no where supernatural effects nor <i>immediate</i>
interpolations of the Godhead, where the regular powers of Nature are
sufficient to effect the great views of the Creator. On the contrary, we
behold every where the most indissoluble union, and the exactest
proportion between cause and effect, every where the most admirable
connection between all the smaller and the lesser parts of the whole,
and between all the mutations and changes that take place therein: we
behold every where fixed, immutable laws, after which all the works of
God, the sun and the smallest grain of sand, the worm and man, the king
of creation, move and act, every where great ends and means that are
proportionate to them. Who can examine the world, without perceiving the
most perfect order whereby it is ruled? And what reasonable man would
conclude from what he <i>does not know, nor can comprehend</i> of the
contrary of those things which he <i>can</i> see and examine? How was it
possible that man could successfully carry on his occupations and
labours without this unalterable order of things? How could he know the
will of his Creator, and how execute it? how conclude with the least
security from what is past, of what will be? how compute the success of
his undertakings, meditations and exertions? What a dreadful scene of
confusion would a world exhibit, wherein the series and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page331" id = "page331">331</a></span>
the connections of things were constantly interrupted through miracles,
or the influence of superior beings. Order is, and ever will be, the
supreme law of Nature; respect, therefore, this law, take it for your
guide on your pilgrimage, and you will avoid the deviations of
superstition.</p>

<p>Superstition misconceives this order of things, expects effects
without causes, or from such causes as have no relation to them; it
arbitrarily transforms the nature of things, separates what is
indissolubly connected, and connect in the same arbitrary manner things
which evidently contradict each other, or are not connected at all.</p>

<p>Superstition obliterates the natural limits of created beings,
imputing to them qualities and powers which they do not, nor can
possess, if they shall be and continue to be what they really are. The
superstitious expects every where miracles and exceptions from the
stated rules of Nature, and the more wild and confused his fancies are,
the more important solutions of mysteries do they appear to him to
promise. But is not this scorning the laws of the Supreme Ruler of the
world, and censuring the order of things which is founded thereupon? Is
not this exposing the world, which is the work of the Supreme wisdom and
goodness, to all the dangers and confusions of blind fatality, and
destroying all dependance on our reasoning and conclusions, on our
actions, hopes and expectations? Is such a manner of thinking consistent
with a sound knowledge of God, and of the ways of Providence? If you
wish to avoid the delusions and the snares of superstition, that bane of
human happiness, of good order, and of peace of mind, O! then respect
Order as the supreme law of Nature, as the unalterable will of her
Creator and Ruler! Make yourselves acquainted with the regulation of the
world, and the eternal laws after which it is governed; suspect every
thing that is contrary to the regular course of Nature, and do not
foolishly dream that it is in the power of mortal man to change or
abrogate it by means of certain words and formulas, or of certain
mysterious ceremonies. Endeavour to trace out the natural cause of every
effect, and if you cannot find it, at least take care not to yield to
the self-conceited idea, that there exists no natural cause, because you
are too short-sighted to see it. Let your system of reasoning be
governed by the same accurate connection, the same natural combination
and order you behold in the whole creation, and you will not be
surprised by self-delusion, or the deceptions of impostors.</p>

<p><i>Reason is the greatest prerogative of Man</i>; a second truth that
powerfully can guard us against the wiles of superstition.</p>

<p>What distinguishes us more eminently from all other inhabitants of
our globe, what renders us more the resemblance of our Maker than
<i>Reason?</i> the faculty of tracing out the causes of things, of
forming just ideas of their connections with each other, and of deducing
firm conclusions from what we know, of what we do not know? Our sensible
organs and sensations we have in common with the beasts of the field;
reason only renders us superior to them. Reason enables us to discover
the delusions of our senses, or to compare and adjust the impressions we
have received from
<span class = "pagenum">331b</span>
external objects. By the light of reason we can investigate the origin
of our feelings, trace out their secret causes and their turns, and
raise them to clear notions. Assisted by reason, we can govern every
other faculty of our mind, strengthen or weaken, and direct it in a
manner which is most favourable for the discovery and examination of
truth. Without reason every natural phenomenon would confound us, and
every uncommon effect it produces fill our soul with fear and
consternation; without reason we should be the sport of our own passions
and of those of others.</p>

<p>Superstition does, however, not argue thus. The superstitious and the
vile disseminator of superstition, despises reason, decries that sacred
prerogative of man, exaggerates her imperfections and weaknesses, hurls
her from the throne on which the Creator has placed her, and raises
sensation and imagination upon it. The superstitious will not think, not
examine nor draw just conclusions; every picture that heats his fancy;
every appearance that blinds his senses; every obscure idea that makes
his blood ferment, is well received by him; he prefers it to every
principle of reason, and every incontestible truth, because they do not
amuse, nor heat his senses and his imagination. The more mysterious, the
more inconceivable a phenomenon, an experience, doctrine or system is,
the more eagerly he takes hold of, and the more firmly does he rely upon
them, because they leave his reason at rest, and promise him great
discoveries without trouble and exertion. But can this be called
honouring human nature and her Creator? is this valuing and making a
proper use of the prerogatives that ennoble human nature? Do we not
degrade ourselves to an inferior sort of beings when trusting to no
other guides but to our senses and feelings, and scorning the dictates
of reason? Is it to be wondered at, when the superstitious entangles
himself in the mazes of delusion, and falls a victim to a self-created
tyrant? If you are desirous to avoid these dark and perilous labyrinths,
if you wish to pursue the road to eternity with peace of mind and
safety, O! then, honour reason as the greatest treasure of man, and
maintain the dignity this gift of all-bountiful heaven confers upon you.
Reject, without hesitation, whatever is contrary to generally adopted
principles of sound reasoning, however charming and seducing it be in
many other respects. Suspect every thing of which you can form no
distinct and clear idea, or no notion at all, every thing that obliges
you to trust merely to an obscure sensation, to your own feelings, or to
those of other people, or to vague pictures of imagination. Suspect
every thing that shuns the investigation of the impartial and cool
examiner; every thing that conceals itself under the veil of
incomprehensible mysteries; suspect every one that attempts to preoccupy
you against reason, and advises you not to be guided by her torch in
your opinion. If the secrets which are offered to you really are
incomprehensible, then you have no interest in them; if they are useful
and important truths, then they must admit examination, and be founded
on firm arguments.</p>

<h4>MISCELLANY.</h4>

<hr class = "w075">

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">When</span> viewing the
race of men upon the large scale, in my spleen, I&nbsp;have divided them
into two classes&mdash;the <i>deceivers</i>, and the <i>deceived</i>.
Indeed so rooted an opinion have I imbibed of the ductility of my
fellow-mortals, that I never seriously believed, nor vindicated, what
are so proudly styled, the honour and dignity of human nature. Read
this, ye unwary, and draw some useful mementos with me. Leave no part of
your body <i>undipped in Styx</i>, and be invulnerable.</p>

<p>See then that <i>Politician</i>, wrapped up in the garb of
patriotism, mount the rostrum, tickle the stupid multitude into
conviction that he is the people’s, the mechanic’s, the poor man’s
friend; that he, indignant of his country’s wrongs, alone feels them and
asserts her rights. Take off that garb, look through the window of his
breast, and see collected, at the apex of his heart, sighs and
flutterings after titles, honours, places. Next turn to the bland
<i>Physician</i>, who, with nerve of steel himself, feels along the
palpitating artery of my Lady Vapour’s, counts its throbs, prescribes a
cordial, and receives a guinea for making madam a dupe. Look after that
<i>military</i> beau that struts through the Mall. A&nbsp;cockade,
a&nbsp;sword, and <i>two</i> epaulets, dazzle the crowd, impose on boys
and girls, men and maidens to imagine, that not danger, nor the devil
himself could appal such a hero. Carry him to the field of honour, and
find him white-liver’d as a hen.</p>

<p>How easily my <i>Lawyer</i>, entrenched with forms and books, gulls
clients of their cash, is too stale to repeat. For <i>once</i> in your
life, be persuaded, that if you come within the circle of his writs,
pleas, bars, demurrers, rejoinders, &amp;c. you will be handsomely
stripped, even to your pin-feathers.</p>

<p>I am all gentleness to the sex: were it not that one smile of a
<i>Coquette</i> makes me a slave, a&nbsp;flirt of a well-manœuvred fan
puts all my resolution asleep, I&nbsp;would not tread on consecrated
ground. While I am sensible, that she is playing me on the line, till
some other gudgeon come in view, when I shall be shaken off the hook;
that I should fancy nought but love in her eyes, on her cheeks but the
down of the peach, her hair <i>all</i> auburn and natural, her lips
<i>two rose leafs dipped in dew</i>, symmetry in her form, taste in her
dress, wit in her repartees, with sincerity in her bosom, is, strange as
it is, inconsistent, inconclusive, and unwarrantable. The theatre, is
all a cheat. The kings, queens, lords and ladies on the stage, we find,
on our streets, are the veriest pieces of mortality. After so much
mockery of our senses, not only divinity is fled; something <i>less</i>
than mortality remains.</p>

<p>I am the first to confess that Fancy cheats <i>me</i> at her will;
not more at the age when I blew the washer-woman’s soap suds through a
pipe into beautiful balloons, than at the period at which I am arrived,
building palaces on earth, and
<span class = "pagenum">332b</span>
castles in air. I&nbsp;have roamed, in Imagination’s car, from the seat
of Paradise in former, to the present degenerate days: I&nbsp;have
searched <i>all</i>, of all ages and countries; and, in abundance have
found, as many simple, deluded, pliable, gazing, cheated, weak-sighted
mortals, as myself. But as virtue is better than vice, so is
<i>delusion</i>, than <i>wretchedness</i>. ’Tis only in regions
superior, the soul finds rest, perfection, and happiness.</p>

Misery. The fresh breeze blew through her loose garments, and cast her
brown hair in disordered, but beautiful masses over her naked bosom: her
eyes were sweet and blue, but they rolled with the quickness of phrenzy
as she approached. “Who are you?” asked I, with emotion, taking her hand

<h4 class = "smallcaps">The ADVENTURES of ALPHONSO and MARINA;</h4>

<p class = "center smallest">AN INTERESTING SPANISH TALE.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Marina</span>, at
seventeen, was the most admired beauty in Granada. She was an orphan,
and heiress to an immense fortune, under the guardianship of an old and
avaricious uncle, whose name was Alonzo, and who passed his days in
counting ducats, and his nights in silencing serenades, nocturnally
addressed to Marina. His design was to marry her, for the sake of her
great fortune, to his own son, Henriquez, who had studied ten years in
the university of Salamanca, and was now able to explain Cornelius Nepos
tolerably well.</p>

<p>Almost all the cavaliers of Granada were in love with Marina. As they
could obtain a sight of her only at mass, the church she frequented was
filled with great numbers of the handsomest and most accomplished youths
of the country.</p>

<p>One of the most distinguished among these, was Don Alphonso,
a&nbsp;captain of cavalry, about twenty, not very rich, but of a family
of the first distinction. Handsome, polite, and witty, he attracted the
eyes of all the ladies of Granada; though he himself paid attention to
none but Marina, who, not insensible to his attachment, began, on her
part, to take notice of her admirer.</p>

<p>Two months passed away without the lovers daring to speak;
nevertheless, they silently said much. At the end of that time Don
Alphonso found means to convey a letter to his mistress; which informed
her of what she knew before. The reserved Marina had no sooner read this
letter than she sent it back to Don Alphonso; but, as she possessed an
excellent memory, she retained every word, and was able to return a very
punctual answer, a&nbsp;week afterwards.</p>

<p>A correspondence was now settled between the two lovers; but Don
Alphonso was desirous to be still more intimate. He had long solicited
permission to converse with Marina through her lattices. Such is the
custom in Spain, where the windows are of much more use during the night
than in the day. They are the places of <ins class = "correction" title
= "text has ‘redezvous’">rendezvous</ins>. When the street is vacant and
still, the lover wraps himself up in his cloak, and, taking his sword,
invokes love and night to favour him, and proceeds to some low lattice,
grated on the side next the street, and secured on the inside by
shutters.</p>

<p>He waits not long before the window opens softly, and the charming
maid appears. She asks, in a tremulous voice, if any one is there. Her
lover, transported at her condescension, endeavours to dispel her fears.
They talk in a whisper, and repeat the same thing a hundred times. Day,
at length, approaches, and they must separate.</p>

<p>Marina’s lattice was on the ground floor, and opened into a narrow
passage, where the houses were ill built, and only inhabited by the
lower class of people. Don Alphonso’s old nurse happened to occupy a
tenement directly opposite the window of Marina. Don Alphonso, therefore
repaired to his nurse. ‘My good woman,’ said he, ‘I&nbsp;have been much
to blame to suffer you to live so long in this miserable
<span class = "pagenum">333b</span>
habitation; but I am now determined to make you amends, by giving you an
apartment in my own house. Come, and reside in that, and leave me to
dispose of this.’</p>

<p>The worthy woman could not refrain from tears, and, for a long time,
refused; but, at last, overcome by his solicitations, she consented to
the exchange, with every expression of gratitude to her benefactor.</p>

<p>Never did any monarch enter his palace with more satisfaction than
Don Alphonso did the hovel of his nurse.</p>

<p>Early in the evening Marina appeared at her lattice. She promised to
repair thither every other night, and she kept her word. These
delightful interviews served only to fan the flame of love, and, very
soon, the lovers nights were constantly passed in pleasing conversation,
and their days in writing passionate epistles.</p>

<p>Just at this time, Henriquez, the intended husband of Marina, arrived
from Salamanca; bringing with him a declaration of his passion in Latin,
which had been written for him by the head of his college.</p>

<p>The lovers consulted each other on this event at the lattice; but, in
the mean time, the old guardian had drawn up a contract of marriage, and
a day was fixed on for the celebration of the nuptials of Marina and
Henriquez.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, the only remedy was to fly into Portugal.
This was determined; and it was also settled that the two lovers, on
arriving at Lisbon, should first marry, and afterwards have recourse to
the law, against the guardian.</p>

<p>Marina was to carry with her a box of jewels, which had been left her
by her mother. These were very valuable, and sufficient to maintain the
happy pair till the decision of their law-suit. To effect this escape,
it was necessary to procure the key of the lattice, and in this Marina
succeeded.</p>

<p>It was resolved also, that the next night, at eleven, Don Alphonso,
after having appointed horses to wait without the city, should come and
fetch Marina; who should descend from the window, into the arms of her
lover, and immediately set off for Portugal.</p>

<p>Don Alphonso spent the whole day in preparations for his departure.
Marina, on her part, was equally busy, in getting ready the little box
she was to take with her. She was very careful to secret in it a very
fine emerald, which had been given her by her lover.</p>

<p>Marina and her box were ready by eight in the evening; and, before
ten, Don Alphonso, who had already provided carriages on the road to
Andalusia, arrived at the appointed spot: his heart beating with
perturbation and hope.</p>

<p>As he <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘approaced’">approached</ins> the place, he heard persons calling for
assistance, and perceived two men attacked by five armed assassins. The
brave and humane Alphonso forgot his own affairs to defend the lives of
the assaulted. He wounded two, and put the other three to flight.</p>

<p>What was his surprise, on more attentively viewing the persons he had
delivered, to perceive they were no other than Henriquez, and Alonzo,
the guardian of Marina. Some desperate young cavalier of the city, who
was in love with Marina, knowing it was intended that Henriquez should
espouse her, had hired bravoes, to assassinate them;
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page334" id = "page334">334</a></span>
and, had it not been for the valour of Don Alphonso, the young scholar
and the old miser would have found it no easy matter to escape.</p>

<p>Alphonso did his utmost to avoid their grateful acknowledgments, but
Henriquez, who piqued himself on having learned politeness at Salamanca,
swore he should not leave them that night. Alphonso, in despair, had
already heard the clock strike eleven. Alas! he knew not the misfortune
that had happened.</p>

<p>One of the bravoes, whom he had put to flight, had passed muffled up
in his cloak, near the lattice of Marina. The night was extremely dark,
and the unfortunate beauty, having opened the window, imagined him to be
Don Alphonso, and presented him the box with joyful impatience: ‘Take
our diamonds,’ said she, ‘while I descend.’</p>

<p>At the word diamonds, the bravo suddenly stopped, took the box,
without speaking a word, and, while Marina was getting out of the
window, fled with the utmost precipitation.</p>

<p>Imagine the surprise of Marina, when she found herself alone in the
street, and saw nothing of him whom she had taken for Don Alphonso. She
thought, at first, he had left her, to avoid raising suspicion or alarm.
She, therefore, hastily walked to a little distance, looked round on
every side, and called in a low voice. But no Alphonso could she see; no
lover could she hear.</p>

<p>She was now seized with the most alarming apprehensions. She knew not
whether it were most adviseable to return home, or endeavour to find the
horses and attendants of Don Alphonso, that were waiting without the
city. She continued to walk forwards, in the utmost uncertainty and
distress, till she had lost herself in the streets; while her fears were
augmented by the darkness and silence of the night.</p>

<p>At length she met a person, whom she asked if she were far from the
gate of the city. The stranger conducted her thither; but she found
nobody waiting as she expected.</p>

<p>She dared not yet accuse her lover of deceiving her: still she hoped
he was at no great distance. She proceeded, therefore, along the road,
fearful of every bush, and calling Don Alphonso at every step; but the
farther she walked the more she was bewildered; for she had come out of
the city on the side opposite to the Portugal road.</p>

<p>In the mean time Don Alphonso found himself unable to get away from
the grateful Henriquez and his father. They would not suffer him to
leave them for a moment, but obliged him to enter the house with them;
to which Alphonso, fearful of betraying his intent, and frustrating his
dearest hopes; and imagining too that Marina might be soon acquainted
with the reason of his <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘daely’">delay</ins>, most reluctantly consented.</p>

<p>Alonzo hastens to the chamber of his ward, to inform her of the
danger he had escaped. He calls, but receives no answer; he enters her
apartment, and finds the lattice open; his cries collect the servants,
and the alarm is immediately given, that Marina is missing.</p>

<p>Alphonso, in despair, immediately offered to go in quest of her.
Henriquez, thanking him for the concern he
<span class = "pagenum">334b</span>
expressed, declared his resolution to accompany him. Alphonso suggested,
that the probability of finding her would be greater, if they took
different roads. Accordingly, he hastened to rejoin his domestics: and
not doubting but Marina had taken the road to Portugal, put his horses
at full speed. But their swiftness only removed him farther from the
object of his love; while Henriquez galloped towards the Alpuxarian
mountains, the way which Marina had actually taken.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Marina continued to wander, disconsolate, along the
road that led to the Alpuxares. Presently she heard the clattering noise
of approaching horses; and at first, imagined it might be her beloved
Alphonso: but, afterward, fearful of discovery, or apprehensive of
robbers, she concealed herself, trembling, behind some bushes.</p>

<p>Here she presently saw Henriquez pass by, followed by a number of
servants. Shuddering at the danger of being again in the power of
Alonzo, if she continued in the high road, she turned aside, and took
refuge in a thick wood.</p>

<p>The Alpuxares are a chain of mountains, which extend from Granada to
the Mediterranean. They are inhabited only by a few peasants. To these,
fear and terror conducted the unfortunate maid. A&nbsp;dry and stony
soil, with a few oak trees, thinly scattered: some torrents and echoing
cataracts, and a number of wild goats, leaping from precipice to
precipice; are the only objects which present themselves at day-break to
the eyes of Marina. Exhausted, at length, by fatigue and vexation, she
sat down in the cavity of a rock, through the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for clefts?">clifts</ins> of which a <ins
class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for limpid?">limped</ins> water gently oozed.</p>

<p>The silence of this grotto, the wildness of the landscape around, the
hoarse and distant murmur of several cascades, and the noise of the
water near her, falling drop by drop into the bason it had hollowed
beneath, all conspired to excite in Marina the most melancholy
sensations. Now she thought herself cruelly abandoned by her lover; and
now she persuaded herself that some mistake had happened: ‘It certainly
could not be Alphonso,’ said she, ‘to whom I gave my diamonds.
I&nbsp;must have been mistaken. No doubt he is now far hence, seeking me
with anxiety and distraction; while I, as far distant from him, am
perishing here.’</p>

<p>While thus mournfully ruminating, Marina, on a sudden, heard the
sound of a rustic flute. Attentively listening, she soon heard an
harmonious voice, deploring, in plaintive strains, the infidelity of his
mistress, and the miseries of disappointed love.</p>

<p>‘And who can be more sensible of this than myself?’ said Marina,
leaving the grotto, in search of this unfortunate lover.</p>

<p>She found a young goatherd, sitting at the foot of a willow, his eyes
bedewed with tears, and intent on the water as it issued from its rocky
source. In his hand he held a flagalet, and by his side lay a staff and
a little parcel.</p>

<p>‘Shepherd,’ said Marina, ‘you are no doubt forsaken by your Mistress:
have pity on one abandoned, like yourself, and conduct me to some
habitation, where I may procure sustenance, at least, though not
repose!’</p>

<h4>ON MATRIMONY.</h4>

<p class = "center smaller">ADDRESSED TO MR. C. L.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">You</span> are desirous,
you say, to see a small sketch and exemplification on the benefits
incumbent and to be experienced by embracing the connubial state of
matrimony.&mdash;I do not profess to be a competent judge in pourtraying
the perfections and incomprehensible felicities which might be enjoyed
by the sweet acquiescence of enlightened minds; but can, by a slight
survey of those incidents which has happened to excite my wandering
attention, anticipate those domestic enjoyments which are experienced by
the moral and virtuous pair. I&nbsp;shall not contend that all who
embrace the matrimonial state, enjoy that pure bliss for which such a
state was morally intended; those who come short of this privilege, are
contracted in their ideas; they are incapable of comprehending and
bringing into sweet subordination the faculties of the human
mind&mdash;and from hence, in time, arises a disgusting aversion to the
sensation and impulse which once stole upon their hearts, and stimulated
them with an eagerness to possess the object of their wishes; every
trifling incident tends to exhilirate evil propensities, and almost all
their converse becomes one continual series of discord and contention:
the spark of affection is now extinguished, and their existence becomes,
as it were, insupportable.&mdash;I readily admit, that such a compact of
misery is very inauspicious, and none more disgusting and unhappy.</p>

<p>But to enjoy the state of matrimony to the greatest advantage and
fullest extent, I&nbsp;think it propitious to be well acquainted with
the disposition of our own hearts; the guidance of our passions we
should be masters of, and always keep reason in our right hand, and evil
propensities at a distance. The feelings which are dishonourable, and
are in direct aversion to <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘purile’">puerile</ins> happiness, may, at intervals, strive to obtain a
seat in the hearts of the most virtuous pair; but, with a little
exertion are defeated and put at defiance&mdash;and now it is that those
joys which are almost supreme and insurpassible take up a residence in
their breasts; they make it their chief and greatest blessing to
cultivate their hearts in
<span class = "pagenum">337b</span>
love and accordant unison&mdash;their social hours roll on in joyous
emotions&mdash;they taste the blessings of a lasting union in affection
and disposition&mdash;they improve the hours of solitude by endearing
and virtuous precepts; and their hearts are ever engaged to eternize
each others happiness, both temporal and spiritual.&mdash;With what
ecstacy do they behold themselves possessed of a little progeny; who, by
their wise precepts, are initiated into morals that enlighten and
beautify the soul; they become ornaments to society, and a soothing balm
to the declining mortality of their revered parents. What state in
existence is so desirable and is productive of such beneficent repose to
the mind that was once prone to wander through the thick mazes of
perplexities, and encounter those versatile haunts of a disturbed
imagination? I&nbsp;hope you will agree with me in my conclusion, that
the matrimonial state, when supported inviolable by enlightened hearts
and conceptions, is the greatest felicity in the reach of mortals, that
existence can afford.</p>

<h4>MAN OF PLEASURE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">To</span> a man of pleasure
every moment appears to be lost, which partakes not of the vivacity of
amusement.&mdash;To connect one plan of gaiety with another is his sole
study, till in a very short time nothing remains but to tread the same
beaten round,&mdash;to enjoy what they have already enjoyed,&mdash;and
to see what they have often seen.</p>

<p>Pleasures thus drawn to the dregs become vapid and tasteless. What
might have pleased long, if enjoyed with temperance and mingled with
retirement, being devoured with such eager haste, speedily surfeits and
disgusts. Hence, having run through a rapid course of pleasure, after
having glittered for a few years in the foremost line of public
amusements, such men are the most apt to fly at last to a melancholy
retreat; not led by religion or reason, but driven by disappointed hopes
and exhausted spirits to the pensive conclusion, <i>that all is
vanity</i>.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Pursue</span> every ray of
light on the road to the sanctuary of truth, while you can account to
yourselves for every step you proceed, and if necessary, can return to
the spot whence you started; but do not venture on dark roads, where,
with every step you proceed, you may lose your way, or be precipitated
into a bottomless abyss. A&nbsp;few clear truths that force themselves
on your understanding as such, and do not infringe on the sacred rights
of your reason, are certainly of far greater value, and can guide you
safer than all occult arts and sciences that force you to renounce the
use of your understanding, and to walk in the dark. Keep firm to the
former, and you will maintain your dignity, and be out of the reach of
superstitious delusions.</p>

<p><i>Man is destinated for an active and a laborious life, and whatever
makes him relinquish, or dislike it, removes him from his
destination.</i> This is the third principle I wish to recommend to the
consideration of the reader who wishes to guard against the insiduous
wiles of superstition. Man is not designed to lead an idle and
contemplative life, but to exert his faculties, and to acquire the means
of happiness. He is destinated to use all his mental and corporeal
faculties, to apply them to useful occupations, and thus to unfold and
to improve them. He therefore, never can grow reasonable and wise, nor
virtuous, rich, and powerful, without his own uninterrupted exertions to
become so. He must learn every thing through meditation and diligent
application, and acquire every thing with trouble and labour, and only
what he thus learns and acquires, he can consider as his property, which
he can rely upon, and use with safety. Man must not expect the
interaction of physical, or moral miracles, for the sake of his
instruction and support, the increase of his wealth, or the restoration
of his health; for if that were the case, he neither would, nor ever
could attain here below, that degree of perfection he is designed to
acquire. Man shall not overleap a single step on the scale of
perfection, but approach the great mark only by degrees, and with
careful steps. Whoever will pay due attention to the institutions and
regulations God has made for the improvement and the education of man,
will be convinced of the truth of this principle.</p>

<p>If, therefore, you wish to execute the will of God, and to attain the
destination for which you are designed, O! then, beware of superstition;
for it goes diametrically against the institutions and regulations which
God has made for the happiness of man, subverts the order of things, and
wants to lead you to the mark without the employment of means, or at
least by unnatural means; promises to conduct you to
<span class = "pagenum">338b</span>
the goal of happiness on a less difficult road than nature has designed.
Superstition promises you wisdom, knowledge, advantages and eminent
qualities, which are to cost you little or nothing, and which you are to
obtain without the least exertion and trouble, through faith, hope, or
mechanical processes and ceremonies. This is, however, not the course of
nature, is not the will of the Creator, nor the damnation of man; it is
the hope and the wish of the lazy and weak, the language of him who is
averse from labour and trouble, and yet wants to reap the fruits arising
therefrom. Apply your faculties according to your destination, apply
them with diligence and chearfulness, perform your duly faithfully, and
enquire for wisdom and knowledge, wealth and honour, health and power,
on the road of activity and usefulness, for this is the only path that
leads to happiness and human perfection.</p>

<p>The last principle I wish to recommend to you as a safeguard against
superstition, is: <i>Man is not designed to foreknow the future events
of his life!</i> and how could he know, by what means foresee them? if
that should be possible, the powers of his understanding, his reason and
his knowledge, either must be so much enlarged that he could form the
most accurate ides of the great concatenation of all possible events and
causes throughout the creation, and then he would not be a mortal, that
is a limited being; (this, however, would be a kind of omniscience,
which is the sole prerogative of the Godhead) or he must be inspired in
a miraculous manner by the Supreme Being, which would infinitely
multiply miracles and wonders, and subvert the wise laws of nature. But
let us suppose the Godhead should really give it in the power of man to
explore his future fate, would he be the happier for it? No, undoubtedly
not! a&nbsp;knowledge of that kind rather would prove the greatest bane
to the happiness of the individual, and of the human race in general.
The villain would grow more daring, and scorn all divine and human laws,
if he could foresee that no temporal bad consequences would attend his
vile course, and every one that could foreknow the blessings which
futurity has in store for him, would anticipate the joys that await him;
so that the expected happiness, when realized, would charm him
infinitely less than if it had surprised him unawares. Many great
geniuses, that through their talents have proved blessings to the world,
and, notwithstanding their unremitted exertions to raise a fortune,
through their services to human kind, lived and died in poverty, would
have relaxed in their zealous endeavours to render themselves useful to
the state, if they could have foreseen their fate; the world would have
been deprived of the fruits of their diligence, and despair would have
utterly destroyed every remnant of comfort which the ignorance of their
future fate has left them; while, on the contrary, heaven-born hope gave
wings to their genius, and animated them to pursue their career with
redoubled alacrity. If the favourite of fortune could foresee that the
fickle Goddess never will prove inconstant to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page339" id = "page339">339</a></span>
him, would this not render him proud and overbearing? would not the firm
persuasion that the uninterrupted continuation of his happy situation
would entirely exempt him from every application to the kindness and
assistance of his fellow creatures, render him neglectful in his
endeavours to preserve their good opinion? while, on the contrary, the
uncertainty in which he is, with respect to his future fate, makes it
his interest to gain the affection of his fellow creatures. If, on the
other side, the favourite of fortune could with certainty foresee that a
time will inevitably arrive when his present happy situation will be
overclouded, his wealth lost, his body racked with excruciating pains,
&amp;c. &amp;c. would not this <ins class = "correction"
title = "two words">fore knowledge</ins> poison the enjoyment of his present
happiness, and render him miserable even in the lap of bliss? In short,
would not the possibility of exploring future events destroy the
felicity of numberless mortals, banish hope, that sweet comforter, and
oftentimes, the only remaining friend of the unfortunate, from this
sublunary world? Would it not frequently render vice more daring, and
break the only staff of suffering virtue? If, therefore, we are
persuaded that a good God rules the world, and that the Supreme Being
watches with a paternal care over the felicity of mankind, we cannot, we
dare not expect, that he ever will suffer man to remove the mysterious
veil that hides futurity from mortal sight! Some of my readers will,
however, perhaps object that, notwithstanding the many bad consequences
which inevitably must arise from a foreknowledge of future events, man
would, at the same time, be enabled to avoid at least those misfortunes
that can be guarded off by vigilance and prudence. I&nbsp;grant that man
would be more <i>capable</i> to take measures against future evils, but
experience authorises me to maintain, that but very few would make such
a wise use of that knowledge. Did not the holy seers of yore, did not
our Saviour foretel the Jews the dire consequences of their
perverseness? and yet did they not bid defiance to the judgments of
punishing Heaven? Does not every Christian know that vice leads to
eternal misery hereafter? and do we not every day behold,
notwithstanding the general belief in that awful truth, thousands and
thousands disregard the warning voice of Heaven, and pursue the road to
eternal destruction with unabated ardour? Is it to be expected that man,
who risks his eternal salvation for the gratification of his desires
during a short and uncertain life, that man who does not tremble at the
certainty of endless misery would be rendered more careful in the choice
of his enjoyments, and in the mode of his proceedings through the
fore-knowledge of future temporal woe? Let us therefore, never presume,
nor even wish to pry into futurity, let us not revolt against the
express command of the great Ruler of the Universe: not regard them that
have familiar spirits, nor seek after wizards and suspect every one who
promises to remove the veil from the hidden face of futurity. Let us
look upon those daring mortals as the greatest enemies to human
happiness, as rebels against the law of heaven, and as impostors
<span class = "pagenum">339b</span>
who abuse our credulity, and under the cloak of occult sciences, make us
subservient to their private views. Let us not be astonished when we now
and then find some of their predictions realized; but always consider
that this is owing merely to accident, and that one truth they utter, is
overbalanced by numberless lies. Let us act up to the best of our
knowledge, fulfil our duties to God and men, confide in the paternal
care of Providence, and he that rules the fate of the whole creation,
will stand our friend and protector in the time of need.</p>

<h4>ON WEALTH.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Among</span> the many
advantages of wealth, that of being able to relieve the necessaries and
indigencies of others is of the greatest value, and most to be prized.
In what class of men shall we place the hard-hearted, ungenerous rich
man? Upon examination of human nature, avarice is no part of it; and so
we shall be forced to list the covetous man among the monsters of this
world.</p>

<p>Let the rich man indulge his appetites, and pursue his expences and
superfluities, if he will: and let him enable his family to indulge
themselves in the same way, if they are so inclined. But surely, then,
he ought to make as many other people easy and comfortable as he
can.</p>

<p>I am not, it is certain, obliged to pinch myself to remove other
people’s pinchings; but if a ring on my little finger has charms enough
in and about it to keep half a score or half a hundred families from
starving, can I hesitate a single moment, whether or no I shall part
with this useless bauble for that end? If a hundred or five hundred
pounds will not make me retrench in any thing, nor interfere with the
figure and circumstances of life that are proper for my family now, or
when I am dead and gone, what can I do better than give it to some other
person or family, who are obliged to live entirely below those
circumstances they are born or bred to? How can I better employ it, than
in raising the spirits, and rejoicing the heart of some melancholy,
depressed poor man? I&nbsp;am mistaken, if the application of a few
hundred pounds this way, would not give a truer sensation of joy and
pleasure than fifty other things, which are often purchased at a very
dear rate.</p>

<p>Be persuaded, then, ye rich and powerful, ye honourable and great, to
do honourable things with the superfluity of your wealth.</p>

<p>Search after ingenious persons, root them out of obscurity, and
obscurity out of them, and call the long-banished muses back to their
antient habitation.</p>

<p class = "center smaller"><span class = "extended">ON HEARING WHAT WAS
PASSING IN ENGLAND RESPECTING THE SLAVE-TRADE</span>.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I admire</span> the
reasoning of the white men; but, with all their sense, it does not
appear that they have thoroughly studied the nature of the blacks, whose
disposition differs as much from that of the whites, as their colour.
The same great Being formed both; and since it hath seemed convenient
for him to distinguish mankind by opposite complexions, it is a fair
conclusion to presume, that there may be as great a disagreement in the
qualities of their minds; there is likewise a remarkable difference
between the countries which we inhabit. You, Englishmen, for instance,
as I have been informed, are surrounded by the ocean, and by this
situation seem intended to hold communication with the whole world,
which you do, by means of your ships; whilst we Dahomans, being placed
on a large continent, and hemmed in amidst a variety of other people, of
the same complexion, but speaking different languages, are obliged, by
the sharpness of our swords, to defend ourselves from their incursions,
and punish the depredations they make on us. Such conduct in them is
productive of incessant wars. Your countrymen, therefore, who alledge
that we go to war for the purpose of supplying your ships with slaves,
are grossly mistaken.</p>

<p>You think you can work a reformation, as you call it, in the manners
of the blacks; but you ought to consider the disproportion between the
magnitude of the two countries; and then you will soon be convinced of
the difficulties that must be surmounted, to change the system of such a
vast country as this. We know you are a brave people, and that you might
bring over a great many of the blacks to your opinions, by the points of
your bayonets; but to effect this, a&nbsp;great many must be put to
death, and numerous cruelties must be committed, which we do not find to
have been the practice of the whites: besides, that this would militate
against the very principle which is professed by those who wish to bring
about a reformation.</p>

<p>In the name of my ancestors and myself I aver, that no Dahoman ever
embarked in war merely for the sake of procuring wherewithal to purchase
your commodities. I, who have not been long master of this country,
have, without thinking of the market, killed many thousands, and I shall
kill many thousands more. When policy or justice requires that men be
put to death, neither silk, nor coral, nor brandy, nor cowries, can be
accepted as substitutes for the blood that ought to be spilt for example
sake: besides, if white men chuse to remain at home, and no longer visit
this country for the same purpose that has usually brought them hither,
will black men cease to make war? I&nbsp;answer, by no means; and if
there be no ships to receive their captives, what will become of them?
I&nbsp;answer, for you, they will be put to death. Perhaps you may be
asked, how will the blacks be
<span class = "pagenum">340b</span>
furnished with guns and powder? I&nbsp;reply by another question, had we
not clubs, and bows, and arrows, before we knew white men? Did not you
see me make <i>custom</i>&mdash;annual ceremony&mdash;for Weebaigah, the
third King, of Dahomy? And did you not observe, on the day such ceremony
was performing, that I carried a bow in my hand, and a quiver filled
with arrows on my back? These were the emblems of the times; when, with
such weapons, that brave ancestor fought and conquered all his
neighbours. God made war for all the world; and every kingdom, large or
small, has practised it more or less, though perhaps in a manner unlike,
and upon different principles. Did Weebaigah sell slaves? No; his
prisoners were all killed to a man. What else could he have done with
them? Was he to let them remain in his country, to cut the throats of
his subjects? This would have been wretched policy indeed; which, had it
been adopted, the Dahoman name would have long ago been extinguished,
instead of becoming, as it is at this day, the terror of surrounding
nations. What hurts me most is, that some of your people have
maliciously represented us in books, which never die; alledging that we
sell our wives and children, for the sake of procuring a few kegs of
brandy. No! we are shamefully belied, and I hope you will contradict,
from my mouth, the scandalous stories that have been propagated; and
tell posterity that we have been abused. We do, indeed, sell to the
white men a part of our prisoners, and we have a right so to do. Are not
all prisoners at the disposal of their captors? and are we to blame, if
we send delinquents to a far country? I&nbsp;have been told you do the
same. If you want no more slaves from us, why cannot you be ingenuous,
and tell the plain truth; saying, that the slaves you have already
purchased are sufficient for the country for which you bought them; or
that the artists, who used to make fine things, are all dead, without
having taught any body to make more? But for a parcel of men, with long
heads, to sit down in England, and frame laws for us, and pretend to
dictate how we are to live, of whom they know nothing, never having been
in a black man’s country during the whole course of their lives, is to
me somewhat extraordinary! No doubt they must have been biassed by the
report of some one who has had to do with us; who, for want of a due
knowledge of the treatment of slaves, found that they died on his hands,
and that his money was lost; and seeing others thrive by the traffic,
he, envious of their good luck, has vilified both black and white
traders.</p>

<p>You have seen me kill many men at the customs; and you have often
observed delinquents at Grigwhee, and others of my provinces, tied, and
sent up to me. I&nbsp;kill them, but do I ever insist on being paid for
them? Some heads I order to be placed at my door, others to be strewed
about the market-place, that people may stumble upon them, when they
little expect such a sight. This gives a grandeur to my customs, far
beyond the display of fine things which I buy; this makes my enemies
fear me, and gives me such a name in the <i>Bush</i><a class = "plain"

neglect this indispensable duty,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page341" id = "page341">341</a></span>
would my ancestors suffer me to live? would they not trouble me day and
night, and say, that I sent nobody to serve them? that I was only
solicitous about my own name, and forgetful of my ancestors? White men
are not acquainted with these circumstances; but I now tell you, that
you may hear, and know, and inform your countrymen, why customs are
made, and will be made, as long as black men continue to possess their
own country: the few that can be spared from this necessary celebration,
we sell to the white men; and happy, no doubt, are such, when they find
themselves on the path for Grigwhee, to be disposed of to the
Europeans&mdash;“We shall still drink water<a class = "tag" name =

<p>The goatherd accepted the offer. Marina gave him a dozen ducats, and,
having learned the road to Gadara, took her leave of the despairing
lover, and returned into the grotto to put on her disguise.</p>

<p>She came out habited in a vest of chamois skin, with a shepherd’s
wallet hanging by her side, and, on her head, a&nbsp;hat ornamented with
ribbands. In this attire she appeared yet more beautiful than when
adorned with brocades and jewels. She took the road to the village, and,
stopping in the market-place, enquired of the peasants, if they knew of
any farmer who wanted a servant.</p>

<p>The inhabitants surround her, and survey the stranger with
admiration. The girls express their surprise at the beauty of her
flowing ringlets. Her elegant form, her graceful manner, the brilliancy
of her eyes, even though dejected, their superior intelligence and mild
benignity, astonish and delight all beholders. No one could conceive
from whence came this beautiful youth. One imagines him a person of high
distinction in disguise; another, a&nbsp;prince in love with some
shepherdess; while the schoolmaster, who
<span class = "pagenum">341b</span>
was at the same time the poet of the village, declared it must be
Apollo, sent down, a&nbsp;second time, to keep sheep among mortals!</p>

<p>Marina, who assumed the name of Marcello, was not long in want of a
master. She was hired by an aged alcaid, or judge of the village,
esteemed one of the worthiest men in the whole province.</p>

<p>This honest countryman soon contracted the warmest friendship for
Marina. He scarcely suffered her to tend his flock for a month before he
gave her an employment within his house, in which the pretended Marcello
behaved with so much propriety and fidelity, that he was equally beloved
by his master, and the servants.</p>

<p>Before he had lived here six months, the alcaid, who was more than
eighty, left the management of all his affairs to Marcello: he even
asked his opinion in all the causes that came before him, and never had
any alcaid decided with so much justice as he, from the time he
permitted himself to be guided by the advice of Marcello, who was
proposed as an example to all the village: his affability, his pleasing
manner, and his good sense, gained every heart. ‘See the excellent
Marcello,’ cried the mothers to their sons, ‘he is perpetually employed
in rendering his old master’s age happy, and never neglects his duty, to
run after the shepherdesses!’</p>

<p>Two years passed away in this manner. Marina, whose thoughts were
continually employed on her lover, had sent a shepherd, in whom she
could confide, to Granada, to procure information concerning Don
Alphonso, Alonzo, and Henriquez. The shepherd brought word back, that
Alonzo was dead, Henriquez married; and that Alphonso had not been seen
or heard of for two years.</p>

<p>Marina now lost all hope of again beholding her lover, and, happy in
being able to pass her days in that village, in the bosom of peace and
friendship, had resolved to bid an eternal adieu to love, when the old
alcaid, her master, fell dangerously ill. Marcello attended his last
moments with all the affection of a son, and the good old man behaved to
him like a grateful father: he died and left all he possessed to the
faithful Marcello. But his will was far from being a consolation to his
heir.</p>

<p>The whole village lamented the alcaid, and, after his funeral rites
were celebrated, the inhabitants assembled to choose a successor. In
Spain certain villages have the right of nominating their own alcaid,
whose office it is to decide their differences, and take cognizance of
greater crimes by arresting and examining the offenders, and delivering
them over to the superior judges, who generally confirm the sentence of
those rustic magistrates; for good laws are always perfectly consonant
to simple reason.</p>

<p>The assembled villagers unanimously agreed, that no one could be so
proper to succeed the late alcaid as the youth whom he seemed to have
designed for his successor. The old men, therefore, followed by their
sons, came with the usual ceremonies to offer Marina the wand, the
ensign of the office. Marina accepted, and sensibly touched by such a
proof of esteem and affection from these good people,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page342" id = "page342">342</a></span>
resolved to consecrate to their happiness a life which she had formerly
intended to dedicate to love.</p>

<p>While the new alcaid is engaged with the duties of her office, let us
return to the unfortunate Don Alphonso, whom we left galloping towards
Portugal, and continually removing farther from the beloved object of
his pursuit.</p>

<p>Don Alphonso arrived at Lisbon, without obtaining any intelligence of
Marina, and immediately returned, by the same road, to search every
place he had before in vain examined; again he returned to Lisbon, but
without success.</p>

<p>After six months ineffectual enquiry, being convinced that Marina had
never returned to Granada, he imagined she might perhaps be at Seville,
where, he knew, she had relations. He immediately hastened to Seville,
and there found that Marina’s relations had just embarked for
Mexico.</p>

<p>Don Alphonso no longer doubted that his mistress was gone with them,
and directly went on board the last ship which remained to sail. He
arrived at Mexico, where he found the relations, but alas! no Marina:
they had heard nothing of her: he, therefore, returned to Spain. And now
the ship is attacked by a violent storm, and cast away on the coast of
Granada; he, and a few of the passengers, save themselves by swimming;
they land, and make their way to the mountains, to procure assistance,
and, by accident or love, are conducted to Gadara.</p>

<p>Don Alphonso and his unfortunate companions, took refuge in the first
inn, congratulating each other on the danger they had escaped. While
they were discoursing on their adventures, one of the passengers began
to quarrel with a soldier, concerning a box, which the passenger
asserted belonged to him.</p>

<p>Don Alphonso desirous to put an end to the contention, obliged the
passenger to declare what it contained, opening it, at the some time, to
discover whether he spoke truth.</p>

<p>How great was his surprise to find in it the jewels of Marina, and,
among them the very emerald he had given her. For a moment he stood
motionless, examining attentively the casket, and fixing his eyes,
sparkling with rage, on the claimant, ‘how came you by these jewels?’
said he, with a terrible voice.</p>

<p>‘What does it signify,’ replied the passenger, haughtily, ‘how I came
by them? It is sufficient that they are mine.’</p>

<p>He then endeavoured to snatch the casket from Don Alphonso; but the
latter, pushing him back, instantly drew his sword, and exclaiming,
‘Wretch, confess your crime, or you die this moment,’ attacked him with
great fury: his antagonist defended himself desperately, but presently
received a mortal wound, and fell.</p>

<p>Don Alphonso was immediately surrounded by the people of the house.
They take him to prison, and the master of the inn sends his wife to
fetch the clergyman of the parish, that he may administer spiritual
comfort to the dying man, while he runs himself, to the alcaid to carry
the casket and inform him of the whole adventure.</p>

<p>How great was the surprise, the joy, and the anxiety of Marina on
perceiving her diamonds, and hearing the behaviour of the noble
stranger!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">342b</span>
<p>She immediately hastened to the inn: the minister was already there;
and the dying man, induced by his exhortations, declared, in presence of
the alcaid, that, two years before, as he was one night passing through
a street in Granada, a&nbsp;lady had given him that box, through a
lattice, desiring him to hold it till she came down, but that he
immediately made off with the jewels; for which theft he asked pardon of
God, and of the unknown lady he had injured. He immediately expired, and
Marina hastened to the prison.</p>

<p>Imagine the palpitations of her heart: she could no longer doubt but
she should again see Don Alphonso, but he was apprehensive of being
known by him: she therefore pulled her hat over her eyes, wrapped
herself up in her cloak, and preceded by her clerk and the gaoler,
entered the dungeon.</p>

<h4>STORY OF TWO CORDELIERS.</h4>

<p class = "center smallest">BY MARGARET VALOIS, QUEEN OF FRANCE.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Two</span> cordeliers,
arriving late one evening at a little village, were obliged to lodge at
a butcher’s, and the chamber where they lay was only separated by a few
boards from that where the butcher and his wife slept. Curiosity led the
cordeliers to hearken what the man and woman were conversing about. The
husband began talking of his domestic concerns, and said, “I&nbsp;must
get up, my dear, to-morrow betimes, and give a look at our cordeliers;
one of them is, I&nbsp;think, in pretty good order, but we will kill
both, and salt them down, which will turn well to our
account.”&mdash;Although the butcher spoke only of his pigs, which he
jocosely called cordeliers, the poor friars were so horribly frightened,
that they were ready to expire with fear, and resolved to save
themselves by jumping out of the window. The thinnest of the two fell
lightly on the ground, and ran as far as the town without waiting for
his companion: the other followed his example; but being very fat, fell
so heavily, that he broke his leg, and with much difficulty crawled to a
little shed which he found not far off, and which proved to be precisely
the place where the pigs (his brother cordeliers) usually lay. Early the
next morning the butcher got ready his knife, and went straight to the
stye:&mdash;“Come, come, my cordeliers,” said he, “come out, come out,
for to-day I am resolved to eat some of your puddings.” The cordelier
cried out for mercy; and the butcher, who concluded that St. Francois
had metamorphosed one of his pigs into a friar, on purpose to punish him
for having sported with the name of a religious order of men, was
overcome with fear; but the matter being soon explained, the good
fathers, in gratitude for their hospitable reception, and fortunate
release from their fears, very peaceably parted with their host, and
very kindly comforted him with their benediction.</p>

<h4><i>LOVE AND FOLLY.</i></h4>

<hr class = "w075">

<h5>LOVE.</h5>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> greatest virtues
that men possess are owing to Love. From whence proceeds the balmy band
of friendship?&mdash;From Love. What felicity would there he in the
marriage state without Love? How wretched are those mortals who are
incapable of friendship, and who feel no satisfaction in loving or being
loved! How morose, how savage, how indelicate, how dull, how cruel would
man be, if exempt from social virtues?&mdash;And from whence do they all
spring, but from Love? I&nbsp;will even go so far as so say, that the
polite arts owe their origin to Love. Even the most celebrated poets
have exerted their utmost skill on the subject of Love. It sooths,
softens, and harmonizes the minds of men, and inspires them with
sentiments of tenderness and humanity. It even disposes them to feel for
their fellow creatures, and comfort the bosom of affliction. It cannot
be denied but men’s glory, honour, profit, and pleasure, all depend upon
Love. Love would wish that all men should live in perfect harmony with
each other, and that there should be no distinction of persons. Love
inspires honour, friendship, charity, humanity, benevolence, modesty,
meekness, and chastity.</p>

<hr class = "w075">

<h5>FOLLY.</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">From</span> the first moment that man was
placed upon earth, he began his life by pursuing the dictates of Folly,
since which his successors have continued to follow the example, and
have improved by her precepts, beyond what their forefathers could have
conceived, or even hoped for. Folly has invented every kind of
excellence that is held in estimation by mankind; luxury, magnificence,
titles, honors, and riches. Folly occasioned one set of men to rule
their fellow creatures, and keep them under subjection. What but folly
could have induced men to search into the bowels of the earth for iron,
gold, precious stones, and a thousand other useless baubles?&mdash;Even
commerce herself would be banished if it were not for Folly. How would
so many lawyers, judges, fiddlers, players, perfumers, embroiderers, and
ten thousand other professions and trades flourish, if it were not from
Folly?</p>

<h4>ANECDOTE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">An</span> elegant writer

the prudence of a couple lately married, who protracted this period of
felicity for thirty-four years. That they should at last think it
necessary to unite in the bands of wedlock, is a striking proof that all
human felicity must sometime or other have an end.</p>

<h4>ON IMPRUDENT FRIENDSHIP.</h4>

<hr class = "w075">

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> considering the
instability of the ties that bind individuals in unison and communion
with each other, I&nbsp;cannot but lament the disgrace which some
miscreants have brought upon themselves by wilfully abusing and burying
in oblivion the origin of all happiness, and at the same time profess
themselves advocates for, and supporters of, the genuine principles of
Friendship; under the mask of which, they deceive and render unhappy the
honest and unsuspecting part of the community. A&nbsp;few remarks on
this important subject may not be unwelcome to the reader.</p>

<p>The words <i>parodox</i>, <i>problem</i>, &amp;c. are never
misrepresented; whereas others, such as <i>honour</i>,
<i>reputation</i>, <i>friendship</i>, &amp;c. are scarcely ever quoted,
unless to be misapplied.</p>

<p>The words <i>friendship</i> and <i>friend</i>, are used, indeed, in
such a variety of senses, all different, that it is almost impossible to
recognize the genuine features of that old-fashioned thing called
Friendship among such a group of unaccountables. A&nbsp;spendthrift,
after various attempts to borrow money, complains, with a sigh, that he
has not a <i>friend</i> left in the world; and another, who has not
quite reached this period, talks, with some pleasure, of meeting a dozen
or two of <i>friends</i> to dine at a tavern.&mdash;Benjamin Bribewell,
Esq. invites his friends to meet at a public hall, and proceed from
thence <i>in a body!</i> and Captain Swagger, who has accepted a
challenge, requests a brother officer to go out with him as his
<i>friend</i>, and see that he be <i>fairly</i> run through the body.
A&nbsp;highwayman who quarrels with his accomplices concerning the
distribution of the booty, wonders that there should be any bickering
among <i>friends</i>. Nor is it very uncommon that two who always own a
friendship for each other, after cutting and bruising one another until
they can scarcely stand, are separated by their
<i>friends</i>&mdash;nay, what is more remarkable, they sometimes shake
hands, and agree to part <i>friends!</i></p>

<p>Such are the common ideas of Friendship; and if such is the only
Friendship men expect to contract, surely they have little reason to
complain if they should be disappointed. After having prostituted the
<i>name</i>, how can they expect the substance? After having dreamt only
of the <i>sign</i>, how can
<span class = "pagenum">345b</span>
they expect the thing signified? If we consider how those connexions
which are called Friendships are formed, we shall the less wonder that
they are unstable with most men: it is sufficient to have been twice or
thrice in each others company, they become thereafter <i>friends</i>,
and we are not to be surprised, if what is formed so hastily, should be
as hastily dissolved. Houses that are thrown up quickly, and while the
materials are green and unseasoned, cannot be expected to last long.</p>

<p>There are, on the other hand, some persons who entertain a notion of
Friendship so very celestial and romantic, as is not to be expected from
the frailty of human nature: They mistake the nature of a <i>friend</i>
just as much as those of whom I have been speaking. They expect
<i>every</i> thing from a friend, and in this are as much in fault as
those who expected <i>any</i> thing. Romantic notions of Friendship are
much cherished in novels and sentimental writings, but their tendency is
often fatal, and at all times pernicious. A&nbsp;very short intercourse
with the world of men, convinces them that they have been reading of
ideal beings, and their tempers are apt to be soured; in consequence of
which, they entertain worse perceptions of men than they deserve.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of men who are strangers to true Friendship,
although they may attain the habit, and appear in outward profession to
be sincere; and these are the profane and ignorant, or the immoral.
Those who are unsuspecting may anticipate great satisfaction and delight
by the outward concessions of the designing friend, but they will sooner
or later find, by awful experience, that they have misplaced their
sincere regard, and in retaliation for their good offices, receive
nothing but impious insults and all the injuries that their depraved
<i>friend</i> can inflict.</p>

<p class = "center smallest extended">PREFACE.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">After</span> obtruding my
late productions on the Public, I retired into the country, where I
might have passed fifteen months in endless apathy, had I not felt that
idleness, if not the root of all evil, is at least the bane of all good;
and that however the spirits may be depressed by misfortune, or the body
harrassed by fatigue, the mind, still active, will rather create
visions, and pursue phantoms, than subjugate itself to a total oblivion
of all the blessings of this life.</p>

<p>Though I had little inclination to be perfectly unemployed,
I&nbsp;had as little to busy myself in those works of Fancy and Fiction,
which, under the title of Novels, cost much time and great application;
and in the composition of which so many of my fair countrywomen
eminently excel.</p>

<p>Yet was I determined not to sacrifice the peaceful moments allotted
to me in mental slumbers. I&nbsp;considered that I have seen much; that
I have reflected more; that my reading had not been inconsiderable; and
that I had travelled not without some attention to the men and manners
of various countries; that the recollection of some of these objects
might not only amuse myself, but prove interesting to people less
accustomed to diversity of situation, and, perhaps, less qualified to
draw inferences from what they see.</p>

<p>I concluded then, that without wearying myself so as to deprive my
mind of the repose it required, and at the same time to keep it’s powers
in action, I&nbsp;might devote a part of my time to the recollection and
recital of such of my <i>Wanderings</i> as could not be recounted
without some topics for amusement, and some hints for instruction.</p>

<p>But though I thus draw from the fountain-head of actual observation,
in some cases, and from experience in others, my Reader is not to infer
that my writings will be less entertaining than the <i>Wanderings of
Fiction</i>. For I need not tell those who are capable of making
observation, that almost <i>every</i> life is full of adventure; of
strange transitions and wonderful revolutions; and he that adheres to
simple facts, and relates what passes before him, need seldom have
recourse to fiction for subjects even marvellous, and such as may at
once instruct and delight the Reader.</p>

<p>The principal object of a writer, thus circumstanced, is to select
with discretion, and to relate with effect. In this I know not how far I
may have succeeded, because I am ignorant of the extent of my own
powers, and conscious only of my good intentions.</p>

<p>With these sentiments, and impressed with a due sense for the
favourable reception of my former productions, I&nbsp;humbly submit to
the candour and to the protection of the public my <i>Wanderings of the
Imagination</i>.</p>

<hr class = "w075">

<p><span class = "firstword">During</span> an excursion last Summer, in
the county of Kent, when my finances would not afford me a better
conveyance than a stage-coach, I&nbsp;frequently amused myself, (not, as
is usual, with the different countenances and characters of it’s
passengers) but with those incidents on the road; with which chance not
unfrequently furnished&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>As I was admiring the beauty of the hop-grounds, which flourished in
rich luxuriance near the side of the ocean, a&nbsp;sailor caught my
attention. He no sooner perceived the coach, than he ran eagerly towards
it; his countenance was expressive of something between sorrow and
gladness. On his right side was a stump, which he emphatically held
towards us: his left arm he extended towards the sea, which, as his eye
glanced over, appeared to intimate, “This still remains for the service
of my country!”</p>

<p>Perhaps the chearful tar had no such idea as that which I hastily
formed on seeing him; but his smiling countenance indicated something
above the generality of beggars, who, conceiving that their mutilated
bodies are insufficient to excite pity, aim at a distortion of features,
and a story in which the marvellous bears the strongest part, as better
calculated to impose on the genuine feelings of humanity.</p>

<p>The contrasted appearance of this son of Neptune pleased me; but
while I was ruminating in his favour, I&nbsp;was neglectful of the more
essential mode of serving him; and before I could reach the bottom of my
pocket, the coach drove on, and left him to the chance of a more
favourable moment in the hearts of succeeding travellers, who might
probably be actuated by different feelings than mine to relieve his
necessities. I&nbsp;could not, however, help reflecting, that good
intentions ought to be speedily performed; and that to neglect
opportunities of benevolence, is not conformable to the doctrine and
practice of him who made the human heart.</p>

<p>In the county of Kent, and her little Island of Thanet, Nature is
gaily, and luxuriantly dressed. The extremes of affluence, or penury,
are seldom met with; the lands are fertile, and well cultivated; and the
round bodies of the horses bespeak the ease of their employers. Here are
various little plants elsewhere unknown; and the botanist would find his
labours amply rewarded by strictly scrutinizing the soil of Thanet.</p>

<p>Were I inclined to extend description, I should fully expatiate on
the beauties and manners of this pleasant county; which I saw with
pleasure, and left with regret; but as I intend this to be rather an
irregular journal, than a studied publication, I&nbsp;will bid adieu to
it, and all its delights; and in wishing its inhabitants every enjoyment
that can arise from industry, and benevolence, proceed to give an
account of&nbsp;my</p>

<p>I could never account for national prejudice. It is a narrow-minded
opinion, inconsistent with reason and humanity: it extends itself to
counties, towns, and even villages. The
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page347" id = "page347">347</a></span>
Spaniards are proud&mdash;the Italians and Portugueze
revengeful&mdash;the French barbarous&mdash;and England is supposed to
be, by Englishmen, the <i>only</i> spot of Europe which unites
<i>every</i> virtue, untainted by <i>any</i> vice. Born myself an
Englishwoman and the daughter of a Portugueze, I&nbsp;feel a more
natural propensity towards this country, the harbour of my birth and
education, than towards Portugal; although the laws of England have
sufficiently operated against me, to excuse any prejudice I might in
common justice form against it. These laws (the boast of Englishmen)
have been exercised towards myself with severity, but without justice:
they have been strained against a weak woman, and have proved a galling
yoke of slavery, when they should have served as a barrier against
injustice and oppression; and they have fully convinced me, that in this
<i>Christian</i> kingdom, as elsewhere, the hydra of despotism rears her
head unabashed, if not swayed by a golden sceptre. Money, and its
concomitant, <i>interest</i>, bear all before them. In vain will
talents, merit, and even virtue itself, lay claim to protection; these
are weak prerogatives when opposed to wealth, no matter by what means
acquired. The Nabob, who returns home loaded with the spoils of the
East, to obtain which he has waded through the blood of thousands,
becomes respected as a worthy member of community, as soon as it is
known he is a rich one. But should the same person return to this his
native country, poor, friendless, and forlorn;&mdash;should he urge in
excuse for his poverty the uprightness of his heart, which spurned at
the idea of acquiring wealth by cruelty and usurpation, how would he
then be received? Where would he find the great man to patronize him?
And where, alas! the sympathetic mind to commiserate, and the benevolent
hand to alleviate his necessities? In England I fear, he would not; or,
if he did, it would be more likely in the compassionate breast of a
stranger, than in that of what custom, and custom only, calls <i>an old
friend</i>.</p>

<p>From this dangerous, because most abused of epithets, arises
principally the source of all our misfortunes. We cling to it with eager
hope, and are almost as frequently met by disappointment.</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“Disappointment smiles at Hope’s career!”</p>
</div>

<p>In all our wayward pilgrimage through life, we console ourselves with
the certainty of reciprocal esteem and disinterested friendship. Youth
and prosperity attach themselves to the specious forms of kindness; but
the flattering illusions last no longer than the objects which attracted
them; and the once-admired favourite of Fortune, no longer in possession
of <i>more</i> than the <i>desire</i> to do good, becomes an alien to
the society of which he was once the <i>support</i> and the
<i>pride</i>. This, indeed, seems an argument in favour of misanthropy;
whereas it only strongly inculcates the necessity of limiting our
benevolence and our desires, and submit to the dictates of prudence.</p>

<p>I was particularly led into these reflexions, by a circumstance which
lately occured to me. As I was enjoying my
<span class = "pagenum">347b</span>
meditations in a retired part of St. Jame’s Park, at an hour prescribed
there by custom and fashion, a&nbsp;countenance, of which I had a
slender recollection, met my eye. The meanness of his attire was no
obstacle to my perceiving that he was a <i>gentleman</i>. He walked a
few paces before me, and then sitting down on the first bench, pensively
leaned his head on his hand, and attentively considered me as I past.
I&nbsp;proceeded slowly down the avenue, and took occasion to observe
whether he followed me. He kept his place till my return, when he looked
sorrowfully in my face, and emphatically shook his head. His meaning was
too plain not to be understood: and I answered it by placing myself on
the seat near him.</p>

<p>I believe our looks mutually bespoke a wish, mingled with a sort of
timid fear, about making the first advance; and in this situation we had
probably remained some time longer, had he not as he afterwards told me,
seen something in my face that bore testimony to a feeling heart. With a
tremulous voice, he asked me if he was mistaken in my name, which he
mentioned; and being satisfied that he was right, he added, “No wonder,
Madam, that an interval of twenty-two years, and my present appearance,
should conceal from your remembrance the person of Capt.&nbsp;<span
class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>.”</p>

<p>The expression of his countenance, and the tone in which he uttered
these words, were more <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘covincing’">convincing</ins> proofs of his veracity, than I could
discover in the imperfect traces of a form I had once beheld. That form,
which I once saw the repository of every manly grace, was now palsied
and emaciated, and seemed bending towards the earth, as if anxious to
embrace its last asylum. So true is the observation of an accurate
observer of human life: “He that wanders about the world sees new forms
of misery; and if he chances to meet an old friend, meets a face
darkened with troubles.”</p>

<p>I assured him, that I did indeed remember Capt. S&mdash;&mdash;; but
that surprize and sorrow now damped the joy I should have felt on the
renewal of our acquaintance, had I found him in a situation more worthy
of him. I&nbsp;intreated him to believe, that however hardly fortune had
dealt by him (and that she had dealt hardly I could not doubt), there
still existed some few compassionate hearts; and that I was proud to
place mine among the number. He gently pressed my hand to his lips;
intreated I would name an early day for giving him another meeting in
the same place; and telling me he was then going by appointment to see
<i>his old friend</i>, and former Colonel, Lord G. he tottered down the
avenue, but not till we had agreed on meeting the following morning at
twelve; when he promised to acquaint me with the success of his visit,
from which he already seemed to derive the most sanguine expectations.
My eyes could only follow him for a few minutes, but my heart ceased not
to accompany him throughout the day; and while I pondered on the
vicissitudes of life, and retracing his former situation, I&nbsp;could
not help sorrowfully contrasting it with his present embarrassments.</p>

most fastidious palate.</p>

<p>Essays should resemble this Olio, if their author wish for readers.
When a student sits down to a system, he expects the formality and
method of the schools, but how frequent would be the yawn, if periodical
writings resembled <span class = "smallcaps">Locke</span>’s Essay on

sprightliness and variety. Without these requisites a reader would rise

entertainment.</p>

<p>When cookery was young, viands the most simple were sought; and, in
an ancient bill of fare, acorns and spring water were the first
articles. Time has created alteration; and the refinement of modern
luxury requires <i>made</i> dishes. Plain food daily grows into
disrepute, and, for the substantial sirloin we substitute ragouts and
fricacees, replete with spicery. To gratify modern taste, every thing
must be <i>high seasoned</i>. This irregular appetite affects the
library, as well as the table, and extends to the books, which we read,
as well as to the dishes, which we taste. Motley miscellany, in all its
Proteus forms, aptly christened by the British booksellers “light,
summer reading,” is the favourite amusement of all <i>gentle
students</i>. On this occasion, one might declaim against modern
degeneracy; might compare the tinsel of <span class =
"smallcaps">Kelly</span> with the gold of <span class =
"smallcaps">Addison</span>; might sigh for solid books and dishes, and
invoke <span class = "smallcaps">Hooker</span> and <span class =
"smallcaps">Bacon</span> to write, and a turnspit of Queen <span class =
"smallcaps">Elizabeth</span> to <i>cook</i> for us. But this species of
railing is grown so trite that “’tis a custom more honoured in the
breach, than in the observance.” It is better, with a willing
adroitness, to comply, with what we cannot change, and to form the
“stuff” of our argument, as a tailor cuts a coat, by the rule of
fashion.</p>

<p>A literary adventurer, confident of amusing himself, though almost
hopeless of amusing others, prepares to scribble
<span class = "pagenum">348b</span>
in conformity to the preceding sentiment. Though still juvenile, he has,
for a period of some duration, been in the habit of marking the hues of
“many-colored life.” The morning he gives to books, and the evening to
men; and, from every page that he twirls, and from every character which
he sees, he endeavours, like his renowned predecessor, the Spectator, to
extract amusement or instruction. He is not, however, like him, only an
observer in society, but cheerfully converses even with “wayfaring men,
though fools,” that he may learn some particulars of life’s journey.
With all the restlessness of busy indolence, and with all the volatility
of a humming bird, he roams from object to object, as caprice inspires.
This is the province of a lounger; he is one of “the privileged orders”
in society, and to wander is his vocation.</p>

<p>Thus inquisitive from habit, and thus restless from temper, he
fancies, perhaps presumptuously, that he may now become the herald of
what he has seen and heard. In giving his lucubrations to the world, he
confesses that his nerves thrill with the tremors of timidity. Though he
thinks, with Dr. <span class = "smallcaps">Young</span>, that “fondness
of fame, is avarice of air,” yet, in spite of sober belief, juvenile
ambition</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“Will sink with spleen, or swell with pride,</p>
<p>As the gay palm is granted, or denied.”</p>
</div>

<p>As he is a <i>volunteer</i> in the literary corps, he hopes that
severe discipline will not be exercised. He implores of the critics a
dispensation from an observance of the more rigid rules of method, as he
never was educated in that “drowsy school.” A&nbsp;lover of the
desultory style, his effusions shall keep pace with <span class =
"smallcaps">Sterne</span>’s&mdash;in digression and eccentricity, though
halting far behind him in wit. Such a writer, the logicians must permit
to wander at large,</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“Nor to a narrow path confin’d,</p>
<p>Hedge in, by rules, his roving mind.”</p>
</div>

<p>If he be suffered to remain enfranchised, though abusing his liberty,
he may stray from the high road, yet he hopes never to deviate far from
the boundaries of common sense; and if, in the wildness of volatility,
he sometimes leap the hedge, he will endeavour to catch a butterfly, or
crop a flower. All parties in the <i>State</i>, may read the moderate
sentiments of a writer, who will neither factiously blow the trumpet of
democracy, nor proudly stalk in the aristocratical buskin. All sects in
the <i>Church</i>, may cheerily and charitably unite in the perusal of a
work, intended to amuse as a speculation, not dogmatize as a creed.
Though feminine foibles will be smilingly derided, yet, at the
apprehension of malignant satire from the author of the <i>Farrago</i>,
not a heart need palpitate, a&nbsp;fan flutter, nor a tea-table shake.
If the ladies will “put away those strange gods,” coquetry, futility and
artifice, he will, in, the words of <span class =
"smallcaps">Shakespeare</span>’s weaver, so restrain and aggravate his
voice, that he will roar at them, like any sucking dove, he will roar,
like any nightingale.&mdash;In fine, like every other adventurer, he
promises plausibly; and though he cannot hope to instruct by golden
precept, like <span class = "smallcaps">Pythagoras</span>, or divert by
humour, like <span class = "smallcaps">Falstaff</span>, yet like <span
class = "smallcaps">Sancho Panza</span>, by his very simplicity he may
inform and amuse.</p>

come to the bottom of the stairs than she perceived Don Alphonso. Her
joy almost deprived her of speech; she leaned against the wall, her head
sunk on her shoulder, and the tears bedewed her cheeks. She wiped them
away, stopped a moment to take breath, and, endeavouring to speak with
firmness, approached the prisoner.</p>

<p>‘Stranger,’ said she, disguising her voice, ‘you have killed your
companion. What could induce you to commit such a horrid crime?’</p>

an act of justice; but I am desirous to die. Death alone can end the
miseries, of which the wretch I have sacrificed was the first cause.

name of Marina.</p>

<p>Marina trembled on hearing him pronounce her name. She could scarcely
conceal her transports, but was ready to throw herself into the arms of
her lover. The presence, however, of so many witnesses restrained her.
She, therefore, turned away her eyes, and faintly requested to be left
alone with the prisoner. She was obeyed.</p>

<p>Giving a free course to her tears she advanced towards Don Alphonso,
and offering him her hand, said to him, in a most affectionate tone, ‘Do
you then still love her who lives for you alone?’</p>

<p>At these words, at this voice, Alphonso lifts his head, unable to
believe his eyes. ‘Oh Heavens! Is it&mdash;is it my Marina! Or is it
some angelic being assuming her form? Yes, it is my Marina herself,
I&nbsp;can no longer doubt it,’ cried he, clamping her in his arms, and
bathing her with his tears. ‘It is my love, my life, and all my woes are
ended.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Marina, as soon as she could recover speech, ‘you are
guilty of bloodshed, and I cannot free you from your fetters; but I will
repair to-morrow to the superior judge, will inform him of the secret of
my birth, relate to him our misfortunes, and, if he refuses me your
liberty, will return and end my days with you in this prison.’</p>

<p>Marcello immediately gave orders for the removal of Alphonso from the
dungeon into a less hideous place of security. He took care that he
should want for nothing, and returned home to prepare for his journey,
the next day, when a most alarming event prevented his departure, and
hastened the delivery of Don Alphonso.</p>

<p>Some Algerine galleys, which had for several days pursued the ship on
board which Don Alphonso was, had arrived on the coast, some time after
the shipwreck; and willing to repay themselves for the trouble they had
taken, had determined to land, during the night. Two renegadoes, who
<span class = "pagenum">349b</span>
knew the country, undertook to conduct the barbarians to the village of
Gadara, and fulfilled their promise but too well.</p>

<p>About one in the morning, when labour enjoys repose, and villainy
wakes to remorse, the dreadful cry <i>to arms! to arms!</i> was
heard.</p>

<p>The Corsairs had landed, and were burning and slaughtering all before
them. The darkness of the night, the groans of the dying, and the
shrieks of the inhabitants, filled every heart with consternation. The
trembling wives caught their husbands in their arms; and the old men
sought succour from their sons. In a moment the village was in flames,
the light of which discovered the gory scymitars and white turbans of
the Moors.</p>

<p>Those barbarians, the flambeau in one hand, and the hatchet in the
other, were breaking and burning the doors of the houses; making their
way through the smoaking ruins, to seek for victims or for plunder, and
returning covered with blood, and loaded with booty.</p>

<p>Here they rush into the chamber, to which two lovers, the bride and
bridegroom of the day, had been conducted by their mother. Each on their
knees, side by side, was pouring forth thanks to heaven, for having
crowned their faithful wishes. An unfeeling wretch, remorseless, seizes
the terrified bride; loads her unhappy lover, whom in cruelty he spares,
with chains; and snatches before his face, in spite of his distraction,
his tears, prayers, and exclamations, that prize which was due to him
alone.</p>

<p>There they take the sleeping infant from its cradle. The mother,
frantic, defends it, singly, against an host. Nothing can repel, nothing
can terrify her. Death she braves and provokes. For her child she
supplicates, threatens, and combats; while the tender infant, already
seized by these tigers, starts, wakes, stares, with the wild agony of
terror, on the grim visage of its murderer, and sinks into convulsive
horror and sleep, from which it wakes no more.</p>

<p>Nothing is held sacred by these monsters. They force their way into
the temples of the Most High, break the shrines, strip off the gold, and
trample the holy relics under foot. Alas! of what avail to the priests
is their sacred character? to the aged their grey hairs? to youth its
graces, or to infancy its innocence? Slavery, fire, devastation, and
death are every where, and compassion is fled.</p>

<p>On the first alarm the Alcaid made all haste to the prison to inform
Don Alphonso of the danger. The brave Alphonso demanded a sword for
himself and a buckler for the Alcaid. He takes Marina by the hand, and
making his way to the market-place, thus accosts the fugitives: ‘My
friends, are ye Spaniards, and do ye abandon your wives and children to
the fury of the infidels?’</p>

<p>He stops, he rallies them, inspires them with his own valor, and,
more than human, (for he is a lover, and a hero) rushes, sabre in hand,
on a party of the Moors, whom he instantly disperses. The inhabitants
recover their recollection and their courage; enraged, behold their
slaughtered friends; and hasten in crowds to join their leader.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page350" id = "page350">350</a></span>
<p>Alphonso, without quitting Marina, and ever solicitous to expose his
life in her defence, attacks the barbarians at the head of his brave
Spaniards, and dealing destruction to all who make resistance, drives
the fugitives before him, retakes the plunder and the prisoners, and
only quits the pursuit of the enemy to return and extinguish the
flames.</p>

<p>The day begin to break, when a body of troops, who had received
information of the descent of the infidels, arrived from a neighbouring
town. The governor had put himself at their head and found Don Alphonso
surrounded by women, children, and old men; who, weeping, kissed his
hands, with unfeigned gratitude, for having preserved their husbands,
their fathers, or their sons.</p>

<p>The governor, informed of the exploits of Don Alphonso, loaded him
with praises and caresses; but Marina, requesting to be heard, declared
to the governor in presence of the whole village, her sex; giving, at
the same time, a&nbsp;relation of her adventures, the death of the bravo
by Don Alphonso, and the circumstances which rendered him excusable.</p>

<p>All the inhabitants, greatly affected with her story, fell at the
feet of the governor, intreating pardon for the man to whom they were
indebted for their preservation. Their request was granted, and the
happy Alphonso, thus restored to his dear Marina, embraced the governor,
and blessed the good inhabitants. One of the old men then advanced:
‘Brave stranger,’ said he, ‘you are our deliverer, but you take from us
our Alcaid; this loss perhaps outweighs your benefit. Double our
blessings; instead of depriving us of our greatest, remain in this
village; condescend to become our Alcaid, our master, our friend. Honour
us so far, as to permit nothing to abate our love for you. In a great
city, the cowardly and the wicked, who maintain the same rank with
yourself, will think themselves your equals; while, here, every virtuous
inhabitant will look on you as his father; next to the Deity himself,
you will receive, from us, the highest honour; and, while life remains,
on the anniversary of this day, the fathers of our families will present
their children before you, saying, ‘behold the man who preserved the
lives of your mothers.’</p>

<p>Alphonso was enchanted while he listened to the old man. ‘Yes,’ cried
he, ‘my children, yes, my brethren, I&nbsp;will remain here. My life
shall be devoted to Marina and to you. But my wife has considerable
possessions in Granada. Our excellent governor will add his interest to
ours that we may recover them, and they shall be employed to rebuild the
houses which the Infidels have burnt. On this condition alone, will I
accept the office of Alcaid; and though I should expend in your service,
both my riches and my life, I&nbsp;should still be your debtor; for it
is you who have restored to me my Marina!’</p>

<p>Imagine the transports of the villagers while Alphonso spoke. The
governor was a person of power, and undertook to arrange every thing to
his wish; and, two days afterwards, the marriage was celebrated between
Marina and her lover.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their late misfortunes, nothing could exceed the joy
of the inhabitants. The two lovers long lived in unexampled felicity;
and made the whole district as virtuous and happy as themselves.</p>

<h4>HISTORICAL EXAMPLES OF HUMANITY.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">On</span> the day of the
battle of Dettingen, a musketeer, named Girardeau, dangerously wounded,
was carried near the Duke of Cumberland’s tent. They could find no
surgeon, all of them being sufficiently employed elsewhere. They were
going to dress the duke, the calf of whose leg had been pierced by a
ball: “Begin,” said that generous prince, “with relieving that French
officer, he is more wounded than I; he may fail of succour, and I shall
not.”</p>

<p>Alphonso V. king of Sicily and <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘Arrogan’">Arragon</ins>, was besieging the city of Gayette.
That place beginning to fail of provisions, the inhabitants were obliged
to turn out the women, children, and old men, who were so many useless
mouths.&mdash;These poor people found themselves reduced to the most
direful extremity. If they approached the city, the besieged fired on
them; if they advanced towards the enemy’s camp they there met the same
danger. In this sad condition, those wretches implored sometimes the
compassion of their countrymen, not to suffer them to die with hunger.
Alphonso was moved with pity at this spectacle, and forbid his soldiers
to use them ill. He then assembled his council, and asked the advice of
the principal officers, respecting the manner he ought to act with these
unfortunate people. They all gave their opinion that they ought not to
receive them, and said, that if they perished by hunger, or by the
sword, none could be blamed but the inhabitants, who had driven them out
of the city. Alphonso was offended at their hardness of heart: he
protested he would rather renounce the taking of Gayette than resolve to
let so many wretches die of hunger. He also added, that a victory
purchased at that price would be less worthy of a magnanimous king than
a barbarian and a tyrant. ‘I&nbsp;am not come,’ said he, ‘to make war on
women, children, and feeble old men, but on enemies capable of defending
themselves.’ He immediately gave orders that they should receive all
those unfortunate people into the camp, and caused provisions, and
whatever was necessary, to be distributed amongst them.</p>

<p>A violent tempest, which Alphonso V. king of Arragon, was exposed to
at sea, obliged him to put up into an island. Being there in perfect
security, he perceived one of his gallies on the point of being
swallowed up in the waves, with the equipage and troops that were on
board.&mdash;&mdash;The spectacle excited his compassion, and he
immediately gave orders that they should go and succour those unhappy
people. Hereupon his people terrified at the danger, represented to him,
that it was better to let one ship perish, than expose all the rest to
the danger of ship-wreck. Alphonso did not listen to this advice: but,
without deliberating, embarked on board the admiral’s ship, and
immediately departed to give them timely succour; the rest, seeing the
king expose himself with so much resolution, were animated by his
example, and every one hastened to follow him. The enterprize at length
succeeded; but he likewise ran great risk of perishing, it being so very
dangerous. The generous Alphonso said, ‘I&nbsp;would have preferred
being buried in the sea with all my fleet, rather than have seen those
wretches perish full in my view without helping them.’</p>

<h4>THE AFRICAN’s COMPLAINT.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Phœbus</span> had immersed
his flaming forehead in the Western main&mdash;smoothly glided the wild
zephyrs, gently murmuring amongst the resounding foliage&mdash;Cynthia
in blushing majesty began faintly to gild with silver tints the distant
hills&mdash;a thousand glittering gems sparkled through the
circumambient hemisphere&mdash;Nature seemed smiling to invite to
nocturnal contemplation the sons of philosophy:&mdash;courted by the
enchanting scenes, and enveloped in a pleasing reverie, I&nbsp;walked
forth amongst the surrounding shades.&mdash;&mdash;“Happy, ye freeborn
sons of Columbia,” exclaimed I, “liberty and plenty bless your domestic
retirements; war, devastation, and wide-wasting rapine have fled from
your peaceful shores&mdash;no murderous assassin, or night prowling
incendiary, carries the hidden dagger of slaughter, or dread torch of
destruction to disturb your uninterrupted tranquility; no hostile armies
to snatch from your tender embrace the son, the husband, the father, or
brother&mdash;No.” I&nbsp;would have proceeded, but a voice that seemed
to pierce through my inmost soul issued from the adjacent shades;
despair and anguish vibrated on the fleeting sounds&mdash;my soliloquy
was broken.&mdash;“Farewell every pleasure,” it exclaimed in a voice
rendered almost inarticulate by grief. “Adieu, ye native skies! No more
shall the unhappy Corymbo rest beneath the spreading arbors of
Congo&mdash;No more shall the charms of the lovely Yonka give pleasure
and delight to a bosom racked with the most excruciating pains; Oh, ye
aged parents! what were your feelings, how did your bosoms heave, when
your child, your Corymbo, was torn from you by the cruel unfeeling
Christian&mdash;forced into a floating dungeon more terrible than death
itself&mdash;bartered as a slave&mdash;exposed to contempt and
scorn&mdash;unjustly marked with the whip of tyranny&mdash;his labour
unjustly extorted from him&mdash;denied the common necessaries of
life&mdash;trampled on by a monster, whose avaricious heart outvies the
adamant, unsusceptible of the tender feelings of lost humanity! Oh! thou
invisible being, who sustains the universe! why dost thou suffer thy
votaries to perpetrate such barbarity under the sanction of thy
venerable name?&mdash;Hold. Why do I upbraid heaven? Death will ere long
liberate my distracted soul. Oh! how ineffable glows my breast&mdash;the
delectable
<span class = "pagenum">353b</span>
view showers some drops of comfort into my tortured mind. Flow swift ye
intervening moments! come thou welcome hour! when my spirit shall quit
this sinking frame, and wafted on the wings of wind, shall fearless dart
across the Atlantic and again embrace those tender, once dear, but now
distant companions of my youth.&mdash;But why do I linger. My master is
now waiting to receive an account of my labour&mdash;perhaps the
torturing lash.” Here came back, like an inundation, the remembrance of
his slavery, which only for a moment fled to give room for a beam of
comfort, which soon subsided and left more acute sensations than before.
Sobs and inarticulate expressions were all that he could utter, whilst
in hasty steps he wandered from my hearing. For some moments I remained
stupid, petrified to the spot; still, methought, I&nbsp;heard the sounds
of misery echoing amongst the lonely shades. “Ungrateful countrymen,”
I&nbsp;exclaimed, “why do ye deny those inestimable blessings, to your
fellow men that heaven has so eminently dignified you with? Or, why so
callous to tender pity as to lacerate the flesh of the innocent? Oh, ye
votaries of christianity! how can ye reconcile your execrable conduct
with the precepts of the divine, the exalted and elevated maxims of the
great founder of your system.”</p>

<h4>MIXED COMPANY.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> mind of each sex

character, and the happiness of both depends, in a great measure, on the
preservation and observance of this distinction. For where would be the

this difference was abolished?</p>

<p>If the qualities of both were invariably and exactly the same, no
benefit or entertainment would arise from the tedious and insipid
uniformity of such an intercourse; whereas considerable are the
advantages reaped from a select society of both sexes.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Captain</span>
S&mdash;&mdash; had married in early youth the woman of his heart. Her
fortune was very small; nor did he possess any other independance than
that which arose from his commission. He was allied to many noble
families, and had received an education more suitable to his connections
than his expectations. His Lady was not in any respect his equal; she
was the only child of a poor, but honest, curate in Wales, where she
became acquainted with the Captain, at that time an Ensign in a marching
regiment, quartered at Glamorgan: he saw, became enamoured, and married
her. They lived with economy and comfort about five years, in which time
she bore him a son. This event seemed to operate in their favour, as a
distant relation of his mother’s, whom he had hitherto known only by
name, wrote to him on hearing of it, and in consequence of the good
character which had answered his enquiries, he had deposited in the
hands of Mess. Cox and Greenwood a sufficient sum of money, to enable
him to purchase a company on the first occasion that might offer.</p>

<p>Our young adventurer no sooner received this unexpected letter, than
he solicited and obtained leave of absence, and hastened to London, when
he immediately waited on the gentlemen above-mentioned; and hearing that
the commission was prepared for him, and that the money deposited in
their hands exceeded by some hundreds it’s purchase, he resolved on
joining his company without delay. Little time was required to settle
his affairs: he wrote to Mrs. <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and to his father, strongly
recommending to the latter those dear relatives he committed to his
protection; and inclosing bills to nearly the whole amount of the money
which remained in his hands, he soon after embarked in the first ship to
join the new regiment to which he belonged, and which was at that time
stationed in Jamaica.</p>

<p>Imagine not, gentle reader, that Captain S&mdash;&mdash; thus quitted
all he held dear without a pang. His heart was the receptacle of the
surest feelings of humanity; and if he avoided taking a long, perhaps a
last, farewell, it was order to avoid the too powerful temptation of a
change in his resolution. He figured to himself the tears and intreaties
of an affectionate wife, the winning smiles of an infant boy: and to
their future welfare he gladly sacrificed every selfish idea of present
felicity. These reflections accompanied him throughout a long and
perilous voyage, which was at last completed without any material
occurrence.</p>

<p>It was during his short stay in London that I met with him. The
recent kindness of his kinsman had proved a sure passport into the
houses of his other relations. He procured from them all not only a
general invitation during
<span class = "pagenum">354b</span>
his stay there, but many flattering letters of recommendation to the
principal families and military men whither he was going. His person was
uncommonly graceful, and the bright glow of prosperity beaming on his
fine open countenance, indicated the native honesty that warmed his
heart. I&nbsp;was at that time not more than fifteen; Captain <span
class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> about four-and-twenty. Such an
object was well calculated to awaken the feelings of artless
sensibility. Young and romantic as I then was, I&nbsp;could imagine no
higher delight than that of marrying Captain <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and following his fate “beyond unknown
seas.” Alas! I&nbsp;knew not that he was already the betrothed partner
of a more fortunate fair; and when, on his discovering what I found it
difficult to conceal, he candidly revealed to me his situation,
I&nbsp;could only offer up sighs and tears at his departure, which wore
away <i>almost soon after</i> the object which had created them
disappeared.</p>


<p class = "double w075">&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class = "extended"><i>THIRD WANDERING.</i></h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> next morning I was punctual to
my appointment; but waited above an hour before I perceived Captain
<span class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>. At length he came, and
made no secret to me of what had detained him. He informed me, that
having gone on the preceding day to Lord <span class =
"locked">G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;’s</span> he could with difficulty
gain admission into the hall; where, after having been for some time
insulted by the enquiring looks, and questions, of several impertinent
footmen, he seemed likely to remain; not one of them, though assured he
waited on his Lordship by his own appointment, appearing willing to stir
from their chairs to announce him. He continued there some time; during
which he had the mortification to see several of his old acquaintance
alight from their carriages, and pass, without deigning to look towards
him. He patiently waited the return of these great people, and then
repeated his request of a moment’s audience, which was answered by a
desire that he would call again the next morning, at the same hour.</p>

<p>He went, and <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘sound’">found</ins> orders to admit him. Lord G&mdash;&mdash;, with
that tone of authority which superior fortune always gives so the
supercilious, however polished, and to the ungenerous, however courtly,
reproached him in very acrimonious terms with having suddenly thrown up
his commission, at a time when promotion was becoming general, and his
country particularly demanded his services.</p>

<p>Stung to the heart at a reproof, which while he knew to be severe, he
felt to be just, he alledged, in excuse, what to a delicate mind would
have been an all-powerful one. His <i>wife</i>&mdash;her
<i>situation</i>: Lord <span class = "locked">G&mdash;&mdash;</span>
interrupted him, by telling him that all such feelings should be
sacrificed to self-interest. He then rang his bell, called for his
carriage, and putting a solitary guinea into the hands of Captain <span
class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>, cast reflections on this
conduct, that were as galling as unmerited, and wishing him good
morning, rid himself of a visitor, whose reduced circumstances were his
only mark of inferiority.</p>

<p>I was less surprised than Captain S&mdash;&mdash; at the conduct of
Lord G&mdash;&mdash;; and after making some comments, naturally
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page355" id = "page355">355</a></span>
arising from the transaction, I&nbsp;prevailed on him to accompany me
home, and to relate to me his narrative, which he did in the following
words.</p>

<p>“I was received in Jamaica with much kindness by my brother officers;
and my letters procured me many distinguished attentions from the
principal families there. My intercourse with many gay young men, and
the life of amusement (not to say dissipation) which I led, might, in a
heart less tender than mine, have dispelled the gloom that had hung over
me since my departure from England. But I did not find it so; my mind
perpetually wandered over the past scenes of domestic delight; and my
heart inwardly sighed, as I reflected on the expanse of ocean that
divided me far from them. My wife was young, and ignorant of the world;
and though the letters which she wrote me were filled with love, and
regret, I&nbsp;suffered myself to dread a change in her affections, and
gave way to the most dismal forebodings, which, instead of being
diminished, were augmented by time.</p>

<p>“A captain in our regiment, whose name was <i>Nesbitt</i>, was on the
point of returning on leave of absence to England. The death of his
mother had put him in possession of considerable property, and it was
necessary that he should settle his affairs. My heart prompted me to
make particular overtures of intimacy to Captain Nesbitt, that I might
influence him to see, and give me a particular account of my family. At
that time too, I&nbsp;had unfortunately lost to him a sum of money at
play; which, though not very considerable, was more than I could
command, previous to his departure. On my mentioning it to him, he
treated it lightly, and assured me he had not at that time any occasion
for it. I&nbsp;received from him the most consolatory promises, and we
parted with all the reciprocal good wishes that can be supposed to arise
from a concluded friendship, and an assurance that I should hear from
him frequently on the subject which alone interested my heart.</p>

<p>“Captain Nesbitt was punctual to his word; he wrote me an account of
his safe arrival in London, and that he was going to pass five or six
weeks with a party of his friends at Swansea, from whence he should make
it his first business to wait on Mrs. <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>. The next ship brought me a packet from
herself, in which she mentioned having seen him, and at a time when a
visit from a friend of mine was particularly welcome, as she had just
lost her father, and retired to a small farm-house near Glamorgan, till
she should hear from me in what manner she should dispose of herself.
She solicited my permission to join me in Jamaica, and that I would
negociate her voyage with one of the first returning Captains, that he
might settle in my name for every suitable accommodation. This was the
project I ardently sighed for, but I wished it to come from herself; and
the silence I had observed on it during her father’s lifetime, being no
longer necessary, I&nbsp;answered her in the effusions of a heart filled
with love and gratitude, and gave, as she desired, all proper directions
to forward her approaching departure.</p>

<p>“Nothing but witnessing her safe arrival, could convey such transport
to my mind, as seeing the ship get under
<span class = "pagenum">355b</span>
weigh, that bore my letter, and was charged with the commission to bring
her once more to my arms. I&nbsp;watched the wind and weather with
anxiety, and in idea followed the vessel to her destined port.
I&nbsp;passed the intervening time in fondly anticipating the arrival of
the welcome stranger, and in preparing every thing for her
reception.</p>

<p>“I had particularly attached myself to a Black, of the name of
<i>Scipio</i>. He was the servant of a gentleman whom I visited, who
bought him in his infancy, and treated him more as a favoured inmate,
than a slave. Scipio was possessed of a noble mind, and a heart
susceptible of affection, and gratitude. He loved his master, and
lamented the destiny of those of his countrymen who were less fortunate
than himself. Often would he wonder why they were so; comparing their
labours with his own, and acknowledging their superiority.
I&nbsp;frequently observed him to follow me at a distance in those hours
when, oppressed by thought, I&nbsp;sought the plantain’s friendly shade,
and shunned the converse of mankind; and oft would sorrow overspread his
sable countenance while he watched me, as if fearful of my
destruction.</p>

<p>“I was one day ruminating on my situation, anticipating the pleasure,
yet at the same time dreading the frustration of <i>all</i> my hopes,
when Scipio ran eagerly towards me, and announced the approach of a ship
from England. I&nbsp;climbed the highest point, as if to bring her
nearer to me. It was too soon for me to expect my wife; all I could hope
was a letter from her, and to that I looked with eager joy, as from the
shore I espied the gaily painted vessel, gliding gently over the smooth
surface of the deep, as the welcome harbinger of peace. With a
palpitating heart I hailed her, as she majestically came towards us, but
the flattering dream soon vanished, as I heard her pronounced to be from
<i>Bristol</i>.</p>

<p>“The keen edge of expectation was quickly blunted by the stroke of
disappointment; yet was the selfish idea soon restrained by the
surrounding multitude, as I observed the busy countenances near me, and
reflected that the disappointment of <i>my</i> hopes might be the
completion of <i>theirs</i>. I was inwardly vexed that I had suffered
myself, like a child, to be hurried away by my passions, the ardour of
which had proved so constantly fatal to my peace.</p>

<p>“In a few weeks, several ships from different ports arrived, but none
that brought tidings to me. The only account I heard from England, in
which I could be interested, was a letter received by Lord <span class =
"locked">G&mdash;&mdash;</span> from Captain Nesbitt, inclosing the
resignation of his commission, for reasons which he did not assign<ins

“ONE OF THOSE CLOSE STUDENTS, WHO READ PLAYS FOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT IN
LAW.”</p>

<p class = "right smallest">TATLER.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Every</span> grave author,
who apothegmatizes for the advancement of learning, vehemently insists
on the propriety of superadding application to genius. Much has been
written to invigorate the lassitude of indolence, to expose the
inefficacy of desultory studies, to lash the absurdity of
procrastination, and to journalize the wanderings of the mind. But, deaf
to the warning voice, there still exists a class of students respectable
for talents and taste, who, whenever fickleness waves her wand, fly
mercurially from a stated task, glance on many subjects, and improve
none. Their judgment, pronouncing sentence against themselves,
acknowledges the utility of fixation of thought, and marks, with
mathematical precision, the point on which attention should rest; but
their wayward imagination is eternally making curves. These literary,
like other hypochondriacs, have their lucid intervals; and, at times,
are fully apprized of the <i>flitting</i> nature of their application.
They write many a penitential annotation upon the chapter of their
conduct, and frame many a goodly plan to be
executed&mdash;<i>to-morrow</i>. The paroxysm soon returns; and every
shackle, which sturdy resolution has imposed, their ingenious indolence
will undo.</p>

<p>It is unpleasant to see those, whom nature and fortune have conspired
to befriend, unqualified to gain the eminence of distinction, by a habit
of turning out of the path. With this censurable volatility are commonly
united, brilliant talents, a&nbsp;feeling heart, and a social temper. If
their possessors would even <i>occasionally</i> adopt and practice those
plodding precepts, which dissipation prompts them to deride, they would
discharge with applause every honorable duty of business and of life.
But, instead of turning the meanders of fancy into a regular channel,
they are perpetually <i>roaming</i>, in quest of pleasure. They employ
morning moments, not over learned tomes, but at ladies’ toilets. After a
night of revelry, amid the votaries of wine and loo, they will tell you
of Charles Fox, who, like a man of <i>spunk</i>, at brothels and at
Brookes’s, wenches, gambles, and drinks all night, and, like a man of
genius, harrangues in the house all day. They talk of their privileges,
and swear by the tails of the comets, which are the greatest ramblers in
the universe, that they will be eccentric. The, style of <i>their</i>
legislation is, “be it enacted, by Fancy and her favourites, that
whenever Genius chooses to cut capers, they be, and hereby are,
allowable.”</p>

<p>As I have a cordial aversion to the abstract modes of speculation,
and choose, with Dr. Johnson, to <i>embody</i> opinions, I&nbsp;proceed
to illustrate by two examples; one from the annals of literature, and
one from real life.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">356b</span>
<p>The poet Shenstone was an officer of distinguished rank, in the
regiment of careless bards. Every reader of his works will acknowledge
that they bear “the image and superscription” of genius. But, still, he
was an indolent, uneconomical, volatile character, who, lolling in the
bowers of the Leasowes, wrote pastorals and the school-mistress, when,
by a more vigorous exertion of his talents, he might perhaps have
eloquently charmed the coifed sergeants of Westminster-Hall, or dictated
new maxims of polity to an applauding House of Commons. At the very
moment he was wasting his time and his patrimony, in the erection of
rural altars to Pan and the Dryads, he wrote “Economy,” a&nbsp;poem, in
which he chaunts the praise of the <i>cittish</i> virtues, and gravely
advises his friends to devote at least a <i>rainy</i> day to worldly
prudence. In this production are some thoughts suggested, one may
venture to affirm, by Shenstone’s experience, pertinent to the subject
of this essay. The tolerating reader will pardon their insertion.
Travellers over a dusty desart rejoice at the sight of verdure; and,
disgusted by the insipidity of a meagre Farrago, its readers may exult
to view a quotation.</p>

<p>Of balmy medicine’s various field aspires</p>
<p>The blest refrigerant? vain, most vain the hope</p>
<p>Of future fame, this <i>orgasm</i> uncontrol’d.”</p>
</div>

<p>Who, but the acquaintance of genius and its inconsistencies could
suppose that one, who knew so well the road to fame, should linger at
“caravansaries of rest” by the way? That he, who advises “to collect the
dissipated mind, to shorten the train of wild ideas and to indulge no
expence, but what is legitimated by economy<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">,”&nbsp;</ins>should be desultory in his
application and prodigal of his estate?</p>

<p>I had collected thus much of my weekly oblation to the public, when,
instead of proceeding, as in duty bound, I&nbsp;forgot my own sermon,
and&mdash;sauntered away. Indolence, deriding my efforts, snatched my
pen, overturned my ink-stand, and bade me go and “clip the wings of
time” with a friend. I&nbsp;obeyed, and visited Meander. He is a
juvenile neighbour of mine, placed by his friends with a view to the
profession of the law, in the office of an eminent advocate. The
character of Meander is so various, that it almost precludes
delineation. Were Sterne summoned to describe him, the eccentric wit
would quote his Tristram Shandy, and affirm that Meander was a mercurial
sublimated creature; heteroclite in all his declensions. He has so much
of the wildness of the fifth Henry in his composition, that were I not
versed in his pedigree, I&nbsp;should suppose he descended in a right
line from that prince. His ambitious projects, like the birds of Milton,
tower up to Heaven’s gate, and he starts as many schemes as a visionary
projector. So entirely devoted is he to the cultivation of the Belles
Lettres, that his graver moments, instead of being dedicated to
Blackstone and Buller, are given to Shakespeare and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page357" id = "page357">357</a></span>
Sterne. He reads plays, when he should be filling writs; and, the other
day, attempting to draw a deed, instead of “know all men by these
presents,” he scribbled a simile from Spenser. Notwithstanding his
enthusiastic fondness for the study of polite literature, even from
that, he frequently flies off in a tangent; and the charms of the ladies
and of loo, full often cause him to forget that there is a poet or
novelist in our language. The <i>ignis fatuus</i> of his fervid
imagination is continually dancing before him, and leads him many a
fantastic, weary step “over hog and through briar.” Nothing can be more
sanguine than his plans of study and of steadiness; and nothing more
languid than their execution. When I entered his lodgings,
a&nbsp;domestic informed me that Meander was still in bed, having sate
up all night, with a tavern party of friends. The servant continuing his
narration, added, “that his master talked much of one Churchill, and at
the hour of retiring, suddenly exclaimed,</p>

<div class = "verse smaller w28">
<p>“Wound up at twelve at noon, your clock goes right,</p>
<p>Mine better goes, wound up at twelve at night.”</p>
</div>

<p>I smiled at these traits of my friend’s character, and, as I well
knew that his slender frame was exhausted by the labors of the night,
plying the pasteboard play, vociferating drunken anthems and swallowing
bumpers, in rapid succession, I&nbsp;therefore suffered him to remain
undisturbed. Unwilling, however, to lose that amusement, which was the
object of my visit, I&nbsp;consoled myself for the absence of my friend,
by surveying his apartment, the furniture of which would give one an
idea of Meander’s character, without a personal acquaintance. On a small
table, lay several of his favourite authors, in all the confusion of
carelessness. Among others I noted Shakespeare, Congreve’s comedies,
letters of the younger Lyttleton, Mrs. Behn’s novels, Fielding’s Tom
Jones, and a mountain of pamphlets, composed of magazines and plays. In
the pigeon holes of a desk, I&nbsp;saw a number of loose bits of paper.
These puzzled me sadly. I&nbsp;thought, at first, they contained arcana
of importance; and compared them to the Sybilline leaves of antiquity.
But, I&nbsp;must own that I was a little chagrined, when I discovered
that they were only that species of gambling composition, which I should
call <i>loo assignats</i>, but which, in plainer phrase, are denominated
<i>due bills</i>. On a low window seat, in a dark corner, lay a most
ponderous folio, over which a diligent spider had woven a web of such
size and intricacy, that the insect must of necessity have been months
in spinning it. Curiosity prompted me to brush away this cobweb
covering, and examine the book it concealed. The reader may easily
imagine the state of my risibles, when I found the volume entitled “An
abridgement of the Law, by Matthew Bacon.” A&nbsp;drawer left partly
open, revealed to view a bundle of manuscripts, among which,
I&nbsp;found a diary kept by my friend, some parts of which so
completely illustrated his character, that I proposed, with a few
transcripts from it, to terminate this essay. But, the narrowness of my
limits forbids, and the journal of Meander, the annals of volatility
must be postponed. They shall form the subject of our next
lucubration.</p>

<h4>THE GENEROUS RIVAL.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I have</span> always been
of opinion, that those harmless delusions which have a tendency to
promote happiness, ought, in some measure to be cherished. The airy
visions of creative Fancy serve to divert the mind from grief, and
render less poignant the bitter stings of misfortune. Hope was given to
man, to enable him to struggle with adversity; and, without her chearing
smile, the most trifling distress would cut his thread of life. It was
this fascinating deity that eased the love-lorn Edwin’s fears; her
gentle whispers <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘sooothed’">soothed</ins> each froward care, and extended his view to
scenes of fancied bliss&mdash;to that happy moment when propitious
Fortune should present him with the hand of Laura. Pleasing delusion!
delightful thought! that made the moment of separation less painful,
that soothed the rugged front of peril, and softened the rude aspect of
terrific war.</p>

<p>Edwin was the son of a merchant of some repute in the metropolis; at
the commencement of the present war, he received an appointment in the
army, and was soon after sent with his regiment to the continent.</p>

<p>Laura was the daughter of a banker of considerable eminence,
a&nbsp;member of the British senate, and possessed of a very extensive
fortune. The attachment that subsisted between these young people was
unknown to Laura’s father, the proud, imperious Mr. Dalby, who expected
to marry her to some person of distinction; or, at least, with one who
was equal in point of wealth to <ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing">himself.</ins> For this purpose, he invited the most wealthy
part of the senate, peers and commoners, to his splendid mansion at the
west end of the town; having totally deserted that which had for many
generations been the residence of his ancestors, in the east.</p>

<p>Miss Dalby possessed in an eminent degree, the beauties of the mind,
as well as those of the person; which, exclusive of her fortune, were
sufficiently attractive to a man of sense and discernment. Many of these
visitors became candidates for her election: most of them, however, were
rejected by her father, to whom she was enjoined to report the name and
rank of each person who addressed her on the score of love. Some, the
most wealthy, she was instructed to flatter with hopes of being the
happy man; reserving her affections for him whom the venal parent should
select to be her husband. It was some time before Dalby could fix his
choice, which long hung suspended between an earl and a viscount, of
nearly equal fortune: at length the appearance of a ducal coronet
banished from his mind both the one and the other; and he vainly
flattered himself, in future, to address his daughter by the high
sounding title of&mdash;<i>Your Grace</i>.</p>

<p>The young Duke Delancy, led by curiosity to behold the lady who was
thus exposed to sale&mdash;for, it seems, the intention of Dalby was
generally known&mdash;became enamoured of her person; and, on conversing
with her, found her every thing he could wish. He instantly made
proposals to Mr. Dalby; which, it is almost needless to say, were as
instantly accepted. His grace, knowing that the consent of the daughter
would avail him but little, without possessing that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page358" id = "page358">358</a></span>
of the father, had not discovered to Laura the partiality he entertained
for her; but having, as he imagined, secured the main chance, made a
formal declaration of his love.</p>

<p>Laura listened with profound attention to the impassioned assurances
of affection of the noble duke; and when he paused, in expectation of
receiving a confirmation of his hopes, she raised her blushing eyes, wet
with the tears of anguish, from the ground; and, thanking him for the
honour he intended her, candidly acknowledged the pre-engagement she was
under to the absent Edwin.</p>

<p>Charmed with her candour; and interested by her artless tale, he
determined to resign his pretensions, and support the cause of the young
soldier.</p>

<p>Laura had preserved a regular correspondence with her lover; and he
was, therefore, but too well informed of the desperate situation of his
suit. He longed to fly to the arms of his mistress, but scorned to
desert his post. At length, fortune gave him an opportunity of realizing
his wishes, at a moment when he least expected it. The Republican army
suddenly attacked, in great force, the allied troops: an obstinate
battle ensued, in which Edwin particularly distinguished himself; the
enemy were completely routed; and the young soldier, for the courage he
displayed in the action, was sent to England with the gladsome tidings
of victory. Having delivered the dispatches with which he had been
charged, he hastened to the house of Mr. Dalby; and, gaining admittance,
ran up stairs in the drawing room, where he discovered his noble rival
with the mistress of his heart. His sudden and unexpected appearance
threw the lovely Laura into some disorder; and it was with much
difficulty she retained spirits sufficient to meet her lover’s fond
embrace.</p>

<p>At this critical moment, Mr. Dalby entered the room; having from his
study seen an officer cross the hall; and ascend the staircase. The
words&mdash;“My dear, dear Laura! and do I once more behold thee in my
arms?” from the enraptured Edwin, caught the ears of the astonished
Dalby, who stood fixed and motionless, mute, and almost discrediting the
organs both of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>“Had I known, Sir,” said his grace, who beheld with as much delight
the agitation of Dalby, as the happiness of the youthful pair, “that the
affections of your daughter had been placed on another object,
I&nbsp;should not have offered the smallest violence to her
inclination.”</p>

<p>“My Lord&mdash;my Lord!” stammered out the enraged parent, “she is
under no such engagement as you suppose.” Then stepping up to
Edwin&mdash;“And, pray, who the devil are you, Sir? Some fortune-hunter,
I&nbsp;suppose! But you have missed your mark, young man: be pleased,
therefore, to leave my house; and, if ever you venture here again,
I&nbsp;shall find means&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My dear father!” said Laura, interrupting him, “you surely forget
yourself! The gentleman, whom you thus
<span class = "pagenum">358b</span>
rudely threaten, is our neighbour’s son, Mr. Langley, the West-India
merchant, in Lombard-street.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Langley’s son!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir,” returned Edwin; “and though not blessed with equal
fortune with yourself, I&nbsp;have yet sufficient to support the rank of
a gentleman. I&nbsp;love your daughter; I&nbsp;long have loved her; and
she has taught me to believe that she returns my affection. I&nbsp;ask
no fortune; give me my Laura, and dispose of your wealth in whatever
manner you please!”</p>

<p>“Very romantic, faith!&mdash;And pray, fellow, do you know who you
speak so freely&nbsp;to?”</p>

<p>“O, very well, Sir!”</p>

<p>“That I am George Dalby, Esq. a member of the House of Commons?”
Edwin bowed. “And that I have an estate free and unincumbered&mdash;look
you, Sir, free and unincumbered&mdash;that netts 10,000l.
a&nbsp;year?”</p>

<p>“To none of these acquisitions am I a stranger, Sir,” returned
Edwin.</p>

<p>“And you, Laura, will you so far disgrace yourself and me, to throw
yourself away on a dry-salter’s son?&mdash;A fortune-hunter!&mdash;A
beggar!”</p>

<p>“A what, Sir?” interrupted Edwin, with much warmth. “But I forget
myself&mdash;you are my Laura’s father!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Laura, “I confess that I entertain a partiality for
Edwin. I&nbsp;know his worth; and will renounce all titles, rank and
distinction, wealth and pleasure, to live the partner of his life!”</p>

<p>“Then, by Heaven! as I know my worth. I will renounce you for ever!
and, therefore, hence with your paramour!&mdash;you shall nevermore
enter my doors!”</p>

<p>“Be it so,” said the Duke; “mine are open to receive them! My house,
my home, my fortune, all are theirs; they shall use them at their
pleasure; they shall live in ease, in competence, and enjoy the
pleasures of their loves: while mad ambition, insatiate avarice, and
increasing pride, shall torture you with never-ceasing pangs, and
embitter every future moment of your life!”</p>

<p>The disappointed, mercenary parent, flew, with bitter imprecations,
from his tormentors: the lovers retired with their noble patron; and,
after having spent several days in a fruitless attempt to gain the
consent of Dalby, were united in the holy bands of wedlock. Edwin has
since, from his professional merit, and the interest of his grace,
attained a distinguished rank in the army; and the dislike of Mr. Dalby
to his daughter’s choice has decreased, in proportion as he has risen to
distinction. Several interviews have taken place, through the medium of
their noble friend, and it is believed that time will root from the mind
of Mr. Dalby every unfavourable impression the want of fortune in his
son-in-law occasioned; and that Edwin and Laura will, at last, become
the heirs of his immense property.</p>

<p>The union of this amiable pair has been blessed with two fine boys;
and this increase of family has enlarged their
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page359" id = "page359">359</a></span>
happiness: they still continue to receive the notice of his grace, whom
they consider as the author of their felicity, and invariably
distinguished him by the appellation of <i>The Generous Rival</i>.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Within</span> the gloomy
walls of a prison, far excluded from the glance of man, was immured, him
that once had basked in the sunshine of prosperity, him that had been
the darling pride of a doating father, and him, reader, that was the
next heir to a peerage. But he had woefully broken through the laws of
his country; Despair, that haggard fiend, had sent him, like the beast
of prey, to obtain assistance unlawfully; and wholly guided by her
dictates, he had unknowingly murdered his
parent.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;Spare your anathemas, ye advocates for monarchy, ye who
think sanguinary laws are as necessary as the glittering baubles of a
crown; who imagine the life of the offender is requisite to expiate his
crime&mdash;and consider whether solitary imprisonment is not far more
just. Common humanity would urge you to reply in the affirmative. Then
throw aside the tyranny of custom, and for once let your bosoms swell
with philanthropy.</p>

<p>Him, who is the subject of this tale, lived in an age when no breast
was actuated by these considerations, when man paid the most implicit
obedience to the gilded trappings of royalty, when no such thing as
civil or religious liberty existed.</p>

<p>No ray of light found entrance into his dismal cell: the wisdom of
the contriver had situated it many yards beneath the surface of the
earth. In one corner there had originally been placed a bundle of straw,
which had served the purpose of a bed to many whom fate had singled out
to pay with their lives the forfeit of their crimes; but nought now
remained save here and there a scattering one. On his legs were bound
enormous shackles, under the weight of which a Sampson would have
groaned: nor were his hands exempt from the galling fetters&mdash;and as
for his body, it was nearly cased in iron.&mdash;Unhappy victim of
despotic cruelty!&mdash;</p>

<p>In this dungeon, until he had the “<i>inestimable privilege of a
trial by jury</i>,” he was doomed to receive an earnest of what he was
to expect. With a soul undaunted he patiently bore it all. Now and then
his wife and helpless children would call for a tear of pity, which was
all he could bestow. He would reflect on the crime he had committed; and
discovered to what lengths misery would lead a man&mdash;to the
commission of what in his cooler moments he would spurn from him with
horror.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">It</span> has often been
made a question on my mind, Whether the multiplicity of books in
circulation are an advantage or disadvantage to the morals of
youth?&mdash;That every book ought to be investigated, and that with an
impartial eye before we condemn it, is a fact incontestible. None but
the prejudiced, the weak and the ignorant, will ever attempt to persuade
youth from the pursuit of wisdom. A&nbsp;man possessed of the least
spark of knowledge, would blush to advise others from the investigation
of truth. That book has never yet been printed, which, when examined by
the eye of reason and candor, did not contain something by which we may
be profited. Yet, how numerous are they who will discard the writings of
an author, merely because they have heard it was an improper book. How
forcible is such reasonings! What will be the opinion of the rational
part of the creation concerning such persons, if they argue with such
inconsistency? Will they not justly conclude that a <i>weak</i> head,
and <i>unprincipled</i> heart, guides their opinion? And while they
continue thus to argue, they ought to reflect, if capable of reflection,
that by condemning them without investigating one single principle
whereby they may substantiate their charge, they expose themselves to
censure and contempt. Thus we behold books too often branded with
detestation, and consigned to oblivion, by those pests of society. For
such they truly are, in my opinion, who have the audacity to persuade
youth from a search after knowledge. Consider, O&nbsp;youth, that while
you are obeying the dictates of these <i>all-knowing men</i>, you are
sacrificing your own opinion at the shrine of <i>ignorance</i>. It is
ignorance, united with impudence and conceit, that prompts them to
trespass on your judgment. If they were duly to consider from what
source their knowledge arises&mdash;if they would give themselves more
time to reflect, and that with candor, they would find that all their
profound search and erudition is nothing more than a “sounding brass or
tinkling symbol.” And that as long as they suffer themselves to be led
by the wrong principles which some of our ancestors imbibed, they will
be considered as a mere <span class = "smallroman">BLANK</span> in
society.</p>

<p>I will readily admit, that there are books which, by a constant
application to them, will corrupt and lead astray the
<span class = "pagenum">361b</span>
minds of youth, whose principles are not fully established. Yet, are
they to be prohibited from a perusal of those books? No!&mdash;But guard
them well against the danger, and then let them examine such authors
with attention and candor. Let their youthful minds bestow on them their
just sentence. By being thus accustomed to judge for themselves, they
will be able with clearness and precision to detect impostors, if any of
that description should attempt to impose on their understandings. That
they will have to combat with such characters at some period of their
lives, is beyond a doubt, then being unprepared to answer them, will
they not expose <span class = "smallroman">THEIR</span> folly in obeying
the dictates of men who were guided by self-conceited, superstitious,
and bigotted principles. They are self-conceited, because <span class =
"smallroman">THEIR</span> knowledge is deemed by them to be
<i>superior</i> to the rest of mankind; superstitious, because they
worship as their gods a select number of books by which their rule of
life is formed, and from which they dare not deviate, <ins class =
"correction" title = "text unchanged: error for lest">least</ins> they
should by transgression seal their ruin; bigotted, because they are
<i>callous</i> to the voice of reason, and determined to adhere to their
own principles, however unfounded.&mdash;Such are the men to whose care
the instruction of youth has been too often committed; and who, instead
of expanding and cultivating their juvenile minds with useful knowledge,
by a thorough investigation of every book, have bred them up in
superstitious ignorance, preparing them for the reception of every vice,
which finally proves their ruin.</p>

<h4>AFFABILITY.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> order to render
ourselves amiable in society, we should correct every appearance of
harshness in our behaviour. That courtesy should distinguish our
demeanor, which springs, not so much from studied politeness, as from a
mild and gentle heart. We should follow the customs of the world in
matters indifferent; but stop when they become sinful. Our manners ought
to be simple and natural, and of course they will be engaging.
Affectation is certain deformity&mdash;By forming themselves on
fantastic models, and vying with one mother in every reigning folly, the
young begin with being ridiculous, and end in being vicious and
immoral.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“The</span> last expected
vessels now arrived, and Scipio one morning, hastily entering my room,
with a joyful countenance put a packet into my hands. It was from
England, but the hand-writing, and seal, were unknown to me.
I&nbsp;found it to be from a female distant relation of my wife’s who
assured me that she wrote it at her desire, as she had not courage to
expatiate on a subject, that she knew would be so contrary to my wishes.
She proceeded to inform me, that the health of Mrs. <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> was very seriously affected; owing, in
great measure, to the depression of her mind since my departure; that my
little boy was recovering from the small-pox; and that these
considerations rendered it impossible for her, with safety either to
herself, or the child, to undertake the long voyage she had projected.
She said she had found it necessary to remove to London, for the benefit
of better advice than could be obtained in the country; and she
mentioned a temporary lodging she had taken in the neighbourhood of
Islington, till she should hear farther from me how to dispose of
herself. Mrs. <span class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> added a few
lines, by way of postscript, as a confirmation of the above, and desired
I would write to her under cover to her relation, in whose neighbourhood
she resided.</p>

<p>“I read&mdash;I paused over the letter; and every time my wild ideas
hurried me beyond myself. At one moment, I&nbsp;believed her affections
were estranged from me; that she no longer wished our re-union, but that
indifference had taken place of that affection which it was the study of
my life to cherish and improve. At another, I&nbsp;reproved myself for
the ungrateful, the illiberal idea; and to that thought a still more
poignant one succeeded. The knowledge I had of her tender mind next <ins
class = "correction" title = "text has ‘convincd’">convinced</ins> me,
that her condition was worse than it was described so me. I&nbsp;fancied
her sinking under a load of grief, and on the point of death, while I,
her friend, her natural protector, was far from her; and to this
reflection Reason herself gave way. “Ah,” thought I, “how fatal has been
my desertion of her; and what recompence could promotion, or wealth
itself bestow on me, if purchased by the loss of a wife so tenderly
beloved? She is at this moment suffering under the accumulated horrors
of indigence and slighted affection; and shall I, on whom she has every
claim of love and duty, suffer her to believe that the scorching sun of
this unhealthy climate has had power to dry up in my heart the pure
stream of unadulterated affection? Shall I contemplate her misery, and
allow her to endure it? Ah, no! let me rather return to her as I am,
unpatronized and
<span class = "pagenum">362b</span>
unexpected;&mdash;share with her the scanty pittance acquired by honest
integrity, and trust for the rest to <i>that</i> Providence, which will
never forsake <i>the pure in heart!</i>”</p>

<p>“Full of these ideas, which were hardly formed before they were
unalterably fixed, I&nbsp;waited on lord <span class =
"locked">G&mdash;&mdash;</span> and told him that letters I had just
received demanded my quick return to England. I&nbsp;solicited him to
accept my dismission. The perturbation of my mind was visible on my
countenance. He looked attentively at me, expostulated on the folly of
my conduct; but was soon convinced that advice and expostulation were
equally thrown away on a man who sought no interest but his affections,
and consulted no monitor but his heart. Finding at length that I was
deaf to his remonstrances, he settled matters in due form; and wishing
me a pleasant voyage politely, yet coolly, bade me adieu.
I&nbsp;returned to my lodgings, which but a few days since I had taken
delight in adorning for the reception of my Isabella. How sad, how
solitary every object now appeared! The sight of numberless little
ornaments, peculiar to the country, and which I had selected as from
their novelty the most pleasing to her, now lost every charm, and to the
affectionate, the grateful Scipio, I&nbsp;bequeathed them. I&nbsp;went,
accompanied by him, to the house frequented by the English Captains, and
soon settled an agreement with one of them. As I spoke to him,
I&nbsp;observed the honest tear of sensibility steal down the polished
cheek of the noble Ethiopian, which he wiped off with his hand, as if to
upbraid it with divulging the secret of his heart. A&nbsp;few loose
dollars remained in my possession, after I had settled my different
accounts: I&nbsp;gave them to Scipio; but he disdainfully rejected them,
and told me I robbed him of more than my money could purchase, when I
robbed him of his <i>friend!</i> These were the sentiments of an
untutored negro; a&nbsp;soul unpractised in the wiles of art. Alas, poor
Scipio! Though many a year has revolved, since we parted: though many a
moon has risen to renew the almost extinguished lamp of nature, since I
witnessed in thee that purity of heart which nought but Heaven can
bestow, still are thy virtues present to my mind, and still shall
remembrance, sickening at the past, reflect on thee, with prayers for
thy transition to those mansions, where innocence like thine can alone
meet with its reward!”</p>

<p>The clocks from the neighbouring churches struck three; and vain were
my solicitations to my unhappy friend, he could not be prevailed on to
share my solitary meal: he abruptly left me, with a promise that he
would continue his narrative of the following day.</p>

<h5><i>HISTORY OF CAPTAIN S&mdash;&mdash;.</i></h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">“In</span> a short time I embarked for
England. The weather for some time favoured us; at length the winds, as
if conscious they were wafting me to misery, often swelled the
reluctantly yielding waves, and hurried us back from our progression. In
those hours when sorrow and vexation
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page363" id = "page363">363</a></span>
clouded the brows of the labouring mariners, impatient to reach their
native shore, a&nbsp;heavy indifference to our destiny clung round my
heart; a&nbsp;presentment of I knew not what blasted each rising hope;
and I pondered on the easy transition from human woe, as I surveyed the
fathomless gulph below me. Often did I rejoice, while the rough swell
lifted us on high, that my Isabella was not exposed to those many
dangers of the deep, which we feel but during the time we experience
them. Among my few books, was Falconer’s immortal poem of “<i>The
Shipwreck</i>.” I knew the superstition commonly attendant on sea-faring
people, and I carefully concealed it from their observation. Often in
the dead of night, when all were sleeping round me as if insensible to
fear, I&nbsp;stole from my cabin, impressed by a far different impulse,
and shared the midnight watch, while its appointed guardian sunk into
the arms of happy, but forbidden rest.</p>

<p>At length we quietly reclined on the peaceful bosom of the venerable
Thames. There, where no fears of faithless seas assailed us, my torpid
mind roused itself into action, and awakening every restless faculty of
my soul, suspended me between despair and hope. I&nbsp;eagerly jumped
into the first boat that came near to us, and leaving every thing
belonging to me on board. I&nbsp;took a post-chaise from Gravesend,
where I landed, and ordering the driver to set me down at the direction
I gave him to Islington, soon reached the abode of my new female
correspondent. This person had seen me but once, and would then have
scarcely recollected me, had not the wildness of my manner in enquiring
for Mrs. <span class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> informed her who
I was. She surveyed me with surprize and as I thought, embarrassment.
I&nbsp;requested she would immediately conduct me to my wife’s lodgings,
which she at first seemingly consented to; and then, as if recollecting
herself, observed, that my sudden appearance might perhaps be too
powerful for her newly-recovered health, and proposed my waiting there
till she went herself and apprized her of it. I&nbsp;impatiently brooked
this delay, yet submitted to it in consideration to my Isabella. She
told me it was not more than ten minutes walk from her house; yet I
passed near two hours alone in anxious expectation. It was at this time
the latter end of September; and it was past eight in the evening when I
had reached the house. The night was dark and gloomy; and as I stood
immoveable at the little gate which bounded the small garden allotted to
the habitation, I&nbsp;fancied that every hollow murmur of the wind
responsively echoed to my heart, and sigh’d forth, “<i>Isabella</i>.” At
length they came together; the sound of her voice still vibrates in my
ear, as she faintly pronounced “<i>Is it you?</i>” The darkness of night
prevented me from seeing her: I&nbsp;clasped her in my arms, and rushed
with her into the house. I&nbsp;placed her on a chair, and by the light
of the candle observed her features. Her person was much altered. She
was become thin, and her countenance was overspread with a <ins class =
"correction" title = "text unchanged: error for livid">lived</ins>
paleness. She burst into tears as she exclaimed, “<i>Ah, Frederick, why,
why did you leave me?</i>” I&nbsp;intreated her to be composed under the
certainty that we were met to part no more.
<span class = "pagenum">363b</span>
I&nbsp;enquired for my boy, who was now in his eighth year. She told me
he was placed at a boarding-school, but avoided making any farther
mention of him. It grew late, and a small supper was set before us,
after which I proposed our going home to her lodgings. To my unspeakable
astonishment, she requested that I would not accompany her; and gave for
reason that the people where she lodged, not knowing she expected me,
might be alarmed at the appearance of a stranger being with her in the
night-time. I&nbsp;however insisted, and she consented. Her house was
indeed but a few paces from the one we had just quitted. Its first
appearance struck me. It was fitted up in a style of expensive elegance;
and on the side-board, on which was displayed a quantity of plate, were
two salvers, engraved large enough to be perceived without very accurate
observation, with the initials of her maiden name. I&nbsp;looked at her
with speechless horror, as I stood transfixed to the spot. The powers of
utterance were denied me, I&nbsp;gasped for breath. A&nbsp;loud rapping
at the street door awakened my recollection, and Captain Nesbitt entered
the room. He was in a state of inebriety, and the sight of me staggered
him. “<span class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>,” said he, as
he impudently advanced to take my hand, “I&nbsp;have taken damn’d good
care of your wife in your absence;” and then turning to his guilty
partner, continued, “Isabella, hav’nt I?” At these words, affection,
resentment, all seemed at the moment to die within my breast;
I&nbsp;recollected only that I was in the presence of a woman&mdash;(and
oh, Heaven, <span class = "smallroman">WHAT</span> a woman)&mdash;I
hastily turned to Captain Nesbitt, and enquired where on the following
morning I could speak with him. He appointed the Bedford-arms,
Covent-Garden, at two o’clock. I&nbsp;looked at Isabella, who did not
attempt to speak, but seemed anxious only about her infamous lover.</p>

<p>“I hurried out of the house, scarcely knowing whither I went, and my
steps almost involuntarily conducted me to the one we had left not an
hour before. The little gate was locked, and I repeatedly, and in vain,
called for admittance. At length an unknown female voice answered me
from an upper window, and somewhat rudely requested my retreat. On my
expostulating, and begging only three minutes conversation with the
person I had supped with, she answered me that she was not to be
disturbed; and that if I persisted in alarming the neighbourhood, she
should put me in charge of the watch. With these words she shut the
window, and I walked wherever chance directed me. I&nbsp;came to the
door of a tavern, which stood half open, seeming to invite the weary
traveller. Here I fixed my abode for the night; nor was it long before
my excessive fatigue of mind and body threw me into a state of
wished-for insensibility<ins class = "correction"

<h5><i>MEANDER’s JOURNAL.</i></h5>

<p>April 8, Monday.&mdash;&mdash;Having lately quaffed plenteous
draughts, of the dream of dissipation, I&nbsp;determine to bridle my
fancy, to practice self-denial, to live soberly, and to study with
ardor. That I may with ease discharge the various duties of the day,
I&nbsp;propose, that “Strutting Chanticleer” and myself, should unroost
at the same hour. With this resolve, I&nbsp;couple a determination, to
study law with plodding diligence, and to make my profession, and a
course of history, my capital objects.</p>

<p>Memorandum. Belles lettres must be considered a subaltern pursuit. If
I rise at the dawn, and study jurisprudence till noon, I&nbsp;shall have
the satisfaction to reflect, that I have discharged my <i>legal</i> duty
for the day. This course, duly persisted in, will probably make me
something more than a Tyro, in the language of the law. If I pour over
my folios with the diligence I propose, I&nbsp;shall acquire, in
Blackstone’s phrase, such a legal apprehension, that the obscurities,
which at present confound me, will vanish, and my journey through the
<i>wilderness</i> of law, will, paradventure become delectable.</p>

<p>Tuesday.&mdash;Overslept myself, did not rise till nine. Dressed, and
went out, intending to go to the office; but, as the morning was
uncommonly beautiful, I&nbsp;recollected an aphorism of Dr. Cheyne’s,
that exercise should form part of a student’s religion. Accordingly,
I&nbsp;rambled through the woods for two hours. The magic of rural
scenes diverted Fancy, whom, on my return to the office, I&nbsp;wished
to retire, that her elder sister, Judgment, might have an opportunity to
hold a conference with the sage Blackstone: but, the sportive slut
remained, dancing about, and I found my spirits so agitated, that, to
calm them I took up a volume of plays, and read two acts in Centlivre’s
Busy Body.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">364b</span>
<p>Afternoon, 2 o’clock.&mdash;Took up a folio, and began to read a
British statute; meanwhile, I&nbsp;received a billet, importing that a
couple of my college cronies were at a neighbouring inn, who wished me
to make one of a select party. I&nbsp;complied. The sacrifices to
Mercury and Bacchus, wore away the night, and it was day before I
retired to the land of drowsy head, as Thompson quaintly
expresses&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Wednesday.&mdash;Rose at ten; sauntered to the office and gaped over
my book. Low spirits and a dull morning, had raised such a fog around my
brain, that I could hardly discern a sentiment. Opened a “dissertation
on memory,” read till my own failed. I&nbsp;then threw away my book, and
threw myself on the bed; I&nbsp;can’t tell how long I remained there,
but, somebody shaking me by the shoulder, I&nbsp;opened my eyes and
saw&mdash;the maid, who came to inform me it was 8 o’clock <i>in the
evening</i>, and that coffee was ready.</p>

<p>Thursday.&mdash;Went out at seven, with a determination to attend to
business; thought I might venture to call at a friend’s house; on my
entrance saw a brace of beauties, whose smiles were so animating that
they detained me, “charmed by witchery of eyes,” till noon.
I&nbsp;returned to my lodgings, and finding my spirits too sublimated
for serious study, I&nbsp;beguiled the remainder of the afternoon, by
writing a sonnet to Laura.</p>

<p>Evening.&mdash;Lounged to my bookshelf, with an intent to open
Blackstone, but made a mistake, and took down a volume of Hume’s History
of England. Attention became quite engrossed by his narrative of the
reign of Henry I. A&nbsp;versatile, brilliant genius, who blended in one
bright assemblage, ambition, prudence, eloquence and enterprize; who
received and merited, what I think, the most glorious of all titles,
that of Beauclerc, or, the polite scholar. The formidable folios, which
stood before me, seemed frowningly to ask, why I did not link to my
ambition, that prudence, which formed part of Henry’s fame? The
remorseful blush of a moment, tinged my cheek, and I boldly grasped a
<i>reporter</i>; but, straightway recollecting, that I had recently
supped, and that, after a full meal, application was pernicious to
health, I&nbsp;adjourned the cause Prudence versus Meander, till
morning.</p>

<p>Friday.&mdash;Rose at the dawn, which is the first time I have
complied with my resolution, of unroosting with the cock. “Projecting
many things, but accomplishing none,” is the motto to my coat of arms.
Began my studies, nothing with nice care, the curious distinction in
law, between general and special <i>Tail</i>; at length, I&nbsp;grew
weary of my task, and thought with Shakespeare’s Horatio, that ’twere
considering too curiously, to consider thus. Began to chat with my
companions; we are, when indolent, ever advocates for relaxation; but,
whether an attorney’s office is the place, where idling should be
tolerated, is a question, which I do not wish to determine in the
negative. Finished my morning studies with “Hafen <ins class =
"correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for Slawkenbergius’s">Shawkenbergius’s</ins> tenth decad.”</p>

<p>Afternoon.&mdash;Did <i>nothing</i> very busily till four. Seized
with a lethargic yawn, which lasted till seven, when a dish of coffee
restored animation, and on the entrance of a friend, fell into general
conversation; made a transition to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page365" id = "page365">365</a></span>
the scenes of our boyish days, and till midnight, employed memory in
conjuring up to view, the shades of our departed joys.</p>

<p>Saturday.&mdash;Slept but little, last night. My imagination was so
busy in castle building, that she would not repose. Dreamed that Lord
Coke threw his “Institute” at me. Rose at nine, looked abroad; and the
atmosphere being dusky, and my spirits absent on furlough, felt
unqualified for reading. For several days there has been a succession of
gloomy skies. The best writers affirm that such weather is unfriendly to
menial labour. The poet says</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“While these dull fogs invade the head,</p>
<p>“Memory minds not what is read.”</p>
</div>

<p>Took up a magazine, which I carefully skimmed but obtained no cream.
Cracked, in the Dean of St. Patrick’s phrase, a&nbsp;rotten nut, which
cost me a tooth and repaid me with nothing but a
worm.&mdash;Breakfasted; reflected on the occurrences of the week. In
the drama of my life, procrastination, and indolence, are the principal
actors. My resolutions flag, and my studies languish. I&nbsp;must strive
to check the irregular sallies of fancy. I&nbsp;never shall be useful to
others, till I have a better command of myself. Surely one, abiding in
the bowers of ease, may improve, if industry be not wanting. Alfred
could read and write, eight hours every day, though he fought fifty six
pitched battles, and rescued a kingdom; and Chatterton, the ill-fated
boyish bard, composed, though cramped by penury, poems of more invention
than many a work which has been kept nine years and published at a
period of the ripest maturity. When I fly from business, let ambition,
therefore, <i>think on, and practice these things</i>. I determine,
<i>next week</i>, to effect an entire revolution in my conduct, to form
a new plan of study, and to adhere to it with pertinacity. As this week
is on the eve of expiration, it would be superfluous to sit down to
serious business. I&nbsp;therefore amused myself, by dipping into
Akenside’s “Pleasures of Imagination;” read till five, visited a friend,
and conversed with him till midnight; conversation turned on
<i>propriety of conduct</i>, for which I was a strenuous
advocate&mdash;<span class = "word1">* * * * * * *</span></p>

<p>Here the journal of Meander was abruptly closed. I was curious to
learn in what manner he employed his week of reformation. On the ensuing
Monday he grew weary of his books; instead of mounting Pegasus, and
visiting Parnassus, he actually strode a hack-horse of mere mortal
mould, and, in quest of diversion, commenced a journey. He was
accompanied, not by the muses, but by a party of jocund revellers; and
prior to my friend’s departure, the last words he was heard so say, or
rather <i>roar</i>, were the burden of a well known anacreontic “<i>dull
thinking will make a man crazy</i>.”</p>

<p>The character and journal of Meander scarcely need a commentary.
There shall be none. I&nbsp;was not born in Holland, and only Dutchmen,
are qualified to write notes. But I will make an apostrophe.</p>

<p>Ye tribe of Mercurealists! in the name of prudence, avoid
eccentricity; expand not your <i>fluttering</i> pinions;
<span class = "pagenum">365b</span>
trudge the foot-way path of life; dethrone Fancy and crown Common Sense.
Let each one seek and fulfil his daily task, “one to his farm and
another to his merchandize.”</p>

<h4><i>ANECDOTES.</i></h4>

<p class = "double w075 close">&nbsp;</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A w</span>orthy Clergyman
belonging to a parish in New-England, had the misfortune to have a son
of a flighty and wild disposition: altho’ many were the pious
admonitions of the virtuous father to bring his son’s remissness into
subordination with his own, he had to lament that his injunctions and
assiduous endeavours were fruitless, and far from being productive of
the desired end.&mdash;His son’s heart was so averse to solemnity, that
he could not contain himself at the time of worship, and he was often so
overstocked with frivolity and his mischievous humor, that his father
often noticed it, while preaching, with much regret&mdash;and concluded
upon harsher means than he had before used to bring his son to better
subjection.&mdash;The next sabbath he confined him to his house, and
proceeded to church with the rest of his family, consisting of his wife,
two daughters, and his old negro <i>Tone</i>:&mdash;the service being
nearly half performed, and the pastor speaking with much fervency to his
crouded audience, his voice was all at once drowned by a sudden and
tremendous burst of laughter, from all parts of the church, which
confounded him.&mdash;This laughter was occasioned by the sudden
entrance of his favorite old dog, who always placed himself next the
pulpit door, in full view of the audience; he now appeared decorated in
an old gown and wig powdered and tied on with much taste, which
occasioned such loud peals of laughter, that he with difficulty obtained
an explanation in ten or fifteen minutes. Old Tone, who seemed to be
more in a state of reserve than any other, cried out from the gallery in
great earnestness&mdash;“Massa, Massa! ony you look at our Tray, den you
se what ma-ke dem laff!”&mdash;The parson opening the pulpit door, the
old dog immediately ascended to him, and was so profuse with his
caresses, that the pastor could scarcely dismiss his congregation.</p>

near her bed, the curtain of which was entirely closed.</p>

<p>Transported at length with the pleasure she received from a
particular passage in the music, she hastily put her head out of bed,
and exclaimed. “How well he sings!” The poor Italian singers, who are in
general not remarkable for bravery, were so much frightened by her
voice, and the sudden appearance of such an extraordinary figure, that
they became at once dumb and stupified, and the music immediately
ceased.</p>

<h4>COLLINS’s MONUMENT.</h4>

<p class = "first">A <span class = "smallcaps">Monument</span> of most
exquisite workmanship has been lately erected at Chichester, by public
subscription, to the memory of the poet <span class =

house adjoining to the Cloisters. He is finely represented, as just
recovering from a wild fit of phrenzy, to which he was unhappily
subject, and in a calm and reclining posture seeking refuge from his
misfortunes in the divine consolations of the Gospel; while his lyre,
and one of the first of his poems, lie neglected on the ground. Above
are two beautiful figures of Love and Pity, entwined in each other’s
arms. The whole is executed by the ingenious Mr. <span class =

<h4 class = "smallcaps">The HISTORY of ANTIOCHUS and STRATONICE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Antiochus</span>, a Prince
of great hopes, fell passionately in love with the young Queen
Stratonice who was his mother-in-law, and had bore a son to the old King
Seleuchus his father. The Prince finding it impossible to extinguish his
passion, fell sick, and refused all manner of nourishment, being
determined to put an end to that life which was become
insupportable.</p>

<p>Erasistratus, the physician, soon found that love was his distemper;
and observing the alteration in his pulse and countenance, whensoever
Stratonice made him a visit, was soon satisfied that he was dying for
his young mother-in-law. Knowing the old King’s tenderness for his son,
when he one morning inquired of his health, he told him, that the
Prince’s distemper was love; but that it was incurable, because it was
impossible for him to possess the person whom
<span class = "pagenum">366b</span>
he loved. The King, surprised at this account, desired to know how his
son’s passion could be incurable? Why, sir, replied Erasistratus because
he is in love with the person I am married&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>The old King immediately conjured him, by all his past favours, to
save the life of his son and successor. Sir, said Erasistratus, would
your majesty but fancy yourself in my place, you would see the
unreasonableness of what you desire. Heaven is my witness, said
Seleuchus, I&nbsp;could resign even my Stratonice to save my Antiochus.
At this the tears began to run down his cheeks, which when the physician
saw, taking him by the hand, sir, says he, if these are your real
sentiments, the prince’s life is out of danger; it is Stratonice for
whom he dies. Seleuchus immediately gave orders for solemnizing the
marriage; and the young Queen to shew her obedience, very generously
exchanged the father for the son.</p>

<h4>DESCRIPTION OF A WONDERFUL CAVERN<br>
IN UPPER HUNGARY.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Near</span> Strelitz, an
inconsiderable village in Upper Hungary, is a most wonderful cavern, in
the middle of a large mountain. The aperture which fronts the south, is
eighteen fathoms high, and eight broad; and consequently wide enough to
receive the south wind, which generally blows here with great violence.
Its subterraneous passages consist entirely of solid rock, stretching
away farther <ins class = "correction"
title = "apparent error also in source">south</ins> than has yet been discovered. As far as it is
practicable to go to, the height is found to be fifty fathoms, and the
breadth twenty-six. But the most unaccountable singularity in the cavern
is, that in the heart of winter, the air is warm on the inside; and when
the heat of the sun without is scarce supportable, is freezing cold
within. When the snows melt in the spring, the inside of the cave, where
the surface is exposed to the south sun, <ins class = "correction" title
= "text unchanged">it emits</ins> a pellucid water, which congeals
immediately as it drops, by the extreme cold, the icicles are of the
bigness of a large cask; and, spreading into ramifications, form very
odd figures: the very water that drops from the icicles on the ground,
which is sandy, freezes in an instant. It is observable also, that the
greater the heat is without, the more intense is the <ins class =
"correction" title = "word missing">cold</ins> within; and in the
dog-days, all parts are covered with ice. In autumn, when the nights
grow cold, and the diurnal heats abate, the ice in the cave begins to
dissolve, insomuch, that by winter no more ice is to be seen, the cavern
then becomes perfectly dry and of a mild warmth. At this time it is
surprising to see the swarms of flies and gnats, also bats and owls, and
even of hares and foxes, that make this place their winter retreat, till
in the beginning of spring, it again grows too cold for them.</p>

<h4>ON LITERARY PURSUITS.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> every duty, in
every science in which we would wish to arrive at perfection, we should
propose for the object of our pursuit some certain station even beyond
our abilities; some imaginary excellence, which may amuse and seem to
animate our enquiry. In deviating from others in following an unbeaten
road, though we perhaps may never arrive at the wished-for object, yet
it is possible we may meet several discoveries by the way; and the
certainty of small advantages, even while we travel with security, is
not so amusing as the hopes of great rewards by which the adventurer is
inspired.</p>

<p>This enterprising spirit is, however, by no means the character of
the present age; every person who should now have received opinions, who
should attempt to be more than a commentator upon philosophers, or an
imitator in polite learning, might be regarded as a chimerical
projector. Hundreds would be ready not only to point out his errors, but
to load him with reproach. Our probable opinions are now regarded as
certainties; the difficulties hitherto undiscovered, as utterly
inscrutable; and the writers of the last age inimitable, and therefore
the properest models for imitation.</p>

<p>One might be almost induced to deplore the philosophic spirit of the
age, which, in proportion as it enlightens the mind, increases its
timidity, and represses the vigour of every undertaking. Men are more
content with being prudently in the right, which, though not the way to
make new acquisitions, it must be owned, is the best method of securing
what we have. Yet this is certain, that the writer who never deviates,
who never hazards a new thought, or a new expression, though his friends
may compliment him upon his sagacity, though Criticism lifts her feeble
voice in his praise, will seldom arrive at any degree of perfection. The
way to acquire lasting esteem, is not by the fewness of a writer’s
faults, but the greatness of his beauties, and our noblest works are
generally most replete with both.</p>

<p>An author, who would be sublime, often runs his thoughts into
burlesque; yet I can readily pardon his mistaking sometimes for once
succeeding. True genius walks along a line, and, perhaps, our greatest
pleasure is in seeing it often near falling, without being ever actually
down.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">369b</span>
<p>Every science has its hitherto undiscovered mysteries, after which
men should travel undiscouraged by the failure of former adventurers.
Every new attempt serves, perhaps, to facilitate its future invention.
We may not find the philosopher’s stone, but we shall, probably, hit
upon new inventions in pursuing it. We shall, perhaps, never be able to
discover the longitude, yet, perhaps, we may arrive at new truths in the
investigation.</p>

<p>Were any of these sagacious minds among us, (and surely no nation, no
period could ever compare with us in this particular,) were any of these
minds, I&nbsp;say, who now sit down contented with exploring the
intricacies of another’s system, bravely to shake off admiration, and
undazzled with the splendor of another’s fame, to chalk out a path to
renown for themselves, and boldly to cultivate untried experiments, what
might not be the result of their enquiries, should the same study that
has made them wise, make them enterprizing also? What could not such
qualities, united, produce?</p>

<p>Projectors in a state are generally rewarded above their merit;
projectors in the republic of letters, never. If they are wrong, every
dunce thinks himself entitled to laugh at their disappointment; if they
are right, men of superior talents think their honour engaged to oppose,
as every new discovery is a tacit diminution of their own
pre-eminence.</p>

<p>To aim at excellence, our reputation, our friends, and our all must
be ventured: by aiming only at mediocrity, we run no risque, and we do
little when prudence and greatness are ever persuading us to contrary
pursuits. The one instructs us to be content with our station, and to
find happiness in setting bounds to every wish. The other impels us to
superiority, and calls nothing felicity but rapture. The one directs us
to follow mankind, and to act and think with the rest of the world; the
other drives us from the croud, and exposes us as a mark to all the
shafts of envy or ignorance.</p>

<p>The rewards of mediocrity are immediately paid; those attending
excellence generally paid in reversion. In a word, the little mind which
loves itself, will write and think with the vulgar, but the great mind
will be bravely eccentric, and scorn the beaten road, from universal
benevolence.</p>

<h5><i>HISTORY OF CAPTAIN S&mdash;&mdash;.</i></h5>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“Various</span> are the
stages of human woe; and long is the catalogue of mental
miseries!&mdash;A load of grief, so new, so unexpected, burst with the
early dawn on my distracted senses, and awakened them to everlasting
wretchedness.</p>

<p>“The next morning I went to the Bedford, and enquired for Captain
Nesbitt. The waiter told me he was not there, but asked my name, and
said he had a letter for me. I&nbsp;opened it, and read as follows.</p>

<p class = "inset smaller">“SIR,</p>

<p>“As our meeting might be attended with disagreeable consequences to
both, you must not be surprized at my declining it. I&nbsp;have but
executed the commission with which you intrusted me, and at which you
seem highly offended. As I am going to leave town immediately,
I&nbsp;must beg leave to postpone till my return any thing you must have
to communicate; and remain,</p>

<p class = "center smallcaps">“Sir,</p>

<p class = "center">“Your humble servant,</p>

<p class = "right smallcaps">“James Nesbitt.”</p>

<p>“I pocketed the infamous scrawl, as I shuddered at the depravity of
human nature. My wife, (why cannot I blot out the dear, the sacred
appellation?) was still wound about my heart, nor could I attempt to
slacken, without breaking its every string. Worthless, yet still beloved
woman, was it for this that I crossed the seas? for this that I
submitted to an odious stigma cast upon my conduct, degrading even in
idea to the character of an officer, and a gentleman?&mdash;for this
that I renounced every hope of future advancement?&mdash;Cruel, cruel
Isabella! Better could I behold thee dead; for what can life be to those
who have broken every tie of duty, every claim to the purest affections
that can ennoble the intellectual being?</p>

<p>“In a fit of frenzy, I flew to her lodgings. A fond, foolish hope to
reclaim her, and a wish to see my still innocent child, led me beyond
the bounds of prudence. She had quitted the house, and the people could
not, or would not, inform me whither she was gone. I&nbsp;found by them,
that they knew her only by the name of her seducer; and that my boy,
whom they called by the same name, had accompanied his mother. My next
enquiry was at the house of her relation; she had also left town, as
they said, for some months.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">370b</span>
<p>“I returned to the Bedford-Arms, and hastily scrawled an incoherent
letter, which I left in charge of the waiter there: he unwillingly took
it, under pretence that Captain Nesbitt seldom came to their house, and
it was uncertain when he might see him again. It ran as follows.</p>

<p class = "inset smaller">“SIR,</p>

<p>“If your heart is not callous to every feeling of social humanity,
let me implore you to pity as a man, the distresses to which you have
reduced me. You are young, but let me hope you are not a determined
villain. A&nbsp;time may perhaps arrive, when you will feel, like
<i>me</i>, <span class = "smallroman">WHAT IT IS</span> to be a <span
class = "smallcaps">Husband</span>, and a <span class =
"smallcaps">Father</span>!&mdash;The opinion of the World is of little
import to those, who, blessed with conscious rectitude, can defy its
malice.</p>

<p>“Restore my wife&mdash;restore my child&mdash;I will receive her once
more, as the first, best gift of Heaven; and her errors shall be blotted
from the tablets of my memory. Let me conjure you, Sir, to be the friend
of this unhappy woman; point out to her the path, of duly; and if you
have any real affection for her, make the sacrifice of it to her honour,
and future peace. As you deal by <i>her</i>, may Heaven, in justice,
deal by <i>you!</i></p>

<p>“I take this method of addressing you, in preference to that which a
man of the World might think more consistent with my situation, under
the present circumstances; but I feel, while I am writing it, that I am
no coward, and that were human miseries to be extinguished only in
blood, the last drop of mine should be spilt to save her from
perdition.</p>

<p>“Your answer I shall most anxiously wait for at the Gloucester
Coffee-house, Piccadilly, from the hour of twelve, every morning, till I
receive&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "center">“I am, <span class = "smallcaps">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class = "center">“Your’s, &amp;c.</p>

<p class = "right smallcaps">“Frederick S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>“I waited two days at the Coffee-house without hearing from him.
I&nbsp;impatiently counted every minute, and anticipated the transition
from deep despondency to transcendant joy. I&nbsp;called for coffee,
read, or seemed to read, the papers of the day; and my heart beat at the
shadow of every object I saw approaching towards the house.</p>

<p>“It was near one on the third morning before I heard any tidings
interesting to myself. A&nbsp;waiter then came forward, with a smile,
and told me that a Gentleman enquired for me. Half breathless,
I&nbsp;desired him to be admitted; my trembling limbs could scarcely
support me as he entered, and I begged him to be seated. I&nbsp;asked
him if he came from Captain Nesbitt? He answered in the affirmative, and
I attempted to close the door; but he desired to admit his friend; and
then informed me that he was the bearer of a writ against me, in the
name of Captain James Nesbitt, to whom I stood indebted for the sum of
two hundred pounds, for money lent me by him in the West-Indies.</p>

<p>“I knew full well that a gambling debt was not by law recoverable;
but my heart recoiled at the idea of contesting it, and I determined
immediately to extricate myself, however
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page371" id = "page371">371</a></span>
inconvenient. My stock of money was reduced to four hundred and seventy
pounds. I&nbsp;paid out of it the debt and costs, which were no small
augmentation. I&nbsp;hired a retired lodging, and resolved to wait as
patiently as I could, the result of an event which had robbed me of
every terrestrial joy. Here I lived many months, with sober,
well-disposed people, but gained no intelligence of those for whose sake
alone I still continued to drag on the load of heavy existence.</p>

<p>“I was one morning surprized by the entrance of an attorney, who
produced me two bills; the one for a hundred and twenty pounds, which
debt, he said, had been contracted by Mrs. <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span> for board and lodging; the other,
for twenty-five guineas for one quarter’s schooling and masters for my
boy.</p>

<p>“I candidly declared to him my situation, and my inability to satisfy
these demands; the consequence of which was an immediate arrest; and I
was hurried from my peaceful chamber to the loathsome place appropriated
in Newgate for debtors. Here I pined in misery and want. The course
language of my fellow-prisoners, whose hearts seemed hardened in
proportion to their necessities, offended, and disgusted me. I&nbsp;soon
after heard that Lord <span class = "locked">G&mdash;&mdash;</span> was
arrived in England. I&nbsp;wrote to him, and he sent a servant to me
with momentary relief. Obligation was new to me. Insensibly, and
actuated more by despair than choice, I&nbsp;joined my companions; and
the sight of a few guineas rejoicing them, I&nbsp;proposed our sharing
them together. The sum was not sufficient to relieve me materially; and
as the die of misery was cast, I&nbsp;endeavoured to dissipate its
calamity: I&nbsp;drank&mdash;I laughed&mdash;I joined in their vulgar
jokes, and for a while forgot myself. With the morning, rejected reason
returned, but vanished as my companions of the time
approached&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>“I passed near two years in this state of mental horror, when I was
unexpectedly relieved from it by the commiserating heart of the then
Sheriff, Mr. P. <span class = "locked">L&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span
class = "locked">M&mdash;&mdash;</span>. To that Gentleman it is not
necessary to be personally known. His urbanity, his feelings do so much
honour to human Nature, that she is compelled to acknowledge him her
master-piece. In him the poor find a protector; the oppressed,
a&nbsp;friend. That Gentleman saw, heard my story, and pitied me. His
heart and purse were equally opened; and he seemed to satisfy the one,
while he bountifully took from the other. I&nbsp;endeavoured to evince
my gratitude; but the manly tear glistened in his eye, and I buried it
in my heart. I&nbsp;returned to the house where I had lodged, forlorn
and desolate, and took possession of the garret over my former
apartment.</p>

<p>“I had not been there many days, before the Gentleman above-mentioned
condescended to visit me. He was attended by his lawyer, who had been,
by his directions, with Mrs. <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>. He found her, surrounded by affluence;
the new, but acknowledged favourite of the French Duke de
&mdash;&mdash;. She was regardless of my situation, insensible to my
misery; yet he prevailed on her, partly by intreaty, and partly by
threats, in my name, of appropriating her property,
<span class = "pagenum">371b</span>
to sign an instrument, which he had prepared, and which was a mutual
release from all pecuniary matters between us. Nor did the generosity of
my noble friend stop here: he hastily slipped into my hand a twenty-five
pound note, and hurried down stairs, as if fearful to receive the bare
acknowledgment of obligations which can never, never be repaid!</p>

<p>“Fortune seemed at this time anxious to make me amends for the many
injuries with which she had lately overwhelmed me. The relation, to whom
I had stood indebted for my commission, and who had left unanswered all
the letters I had written to him, now sent for me. He received me with
coldness, bordering on displeasure; and I briefly related to him my
whole story. Ah, what a world of light did this meeting cast over my
bewildered mind!&mdash;He was a very old man, who had been confined some
years to his house by various bodily infirmities; and to such, the
plausible appearance of youth and beauty in distress, is peculiarly
interesting. I&nbsp;found he had received frequent visits from Mrs.
<span class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and had materially
assisted her. Her attentions secured to her his friendship; and she had
art enough to persuade him, that my conduct in the West-Indies had been
such as to-forfeit every claim to his protection. She assured him, that
my commission had been sold to discharge various gambling debts
contracted there. This <ins class = "correction"
title = ", missing">cruel,</ins> this unprecedented injury, soon, however, retorted
on herself; and as “foul deeds <span class = "smallroman">WILL</span>
rise,” I&nbsp;was indebted to her for the vindication of my own
character, and the total overthrow of that of my unnatural accuser.</p>

<p>“My uncle (for by that name I shall henceforth distinguish him) had
found an uncommon affection for my child, who frequently accompanied his
mother in her visits to him. He had been well tutored by her how to
answer any questions that might be put to him; yet where there was no
suspicion, there could be little danger. Mrs. <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> had constantly assured the old gentleman
that she boarded at the house of the relation where I had first seen
her. He found himself one day very ill, and was desirous of the company
of his little favourite. His housekeeper, whom many years service, and
the solitude of her master’s life, had placed on a footing that fell
little short of being mistress of his house, was the person whom he
dispatched for the child: she was nearly as old and infirm as her
master; and as her walks had for several years extended no farther than
to and from the adjacent chapel every Sunday morning, she could have
wished to evade his proposal of shaking her ancient bones in a
hackney-coach, and would gladly have had the commission devolve on the
foot-boy, who, with herself, composed the whole of his household
establishment. But her master, though a very good man, was a very
peremptory one, and she dared not risk his displeasure by a refusal.
Mrs. Wilmot accordingly equipped herself in her Sunday gown and cloak,
and desiring the coachman to drive very gently over the stones, she
sallied forth in quest of the little Frederick; for whom she also, after
the example of her master, felt more than an usual affection<ins class =

pleasure. In another point there is an affinity between us and that
errant steed, so renowned in the volumes of Cervantic chivalry. When we
begin an excursion, the Lord only knows how it will be prosecuted, or
where it will end. Whim and caprice being commonly our guides, and those
personages never keeping in <i>their</i> almanack a list of stages, we
are sometimes most sadly benighted. As this is my day for similitudes,

Though their stock is confessedly small, they have the art of drawing
out a most lengthy texture. Thus an essayist, conscious of the

annual pound of bohea, in such a manner as to make it last.</p>

<p>When I began my second speculation with some general remarks on the
utility of an alliance between application and genius, I&nbsp;little
thought that I should quit my sober task, and commence character
painter. When Fancy handed me a pencil, and bade me sketch the likeness
of Meander, I&nbsp;had no design to ransack his room, or transcribe his
diary; and lastly, when the journal was published, I&nbsp;tremblingly
thought I had said too much, and dreaded lest my readers should complain
that they were surfeited by the Farrago. But they who are even tinged
with the metaphysical doctrine of ideas flowing in a train, will not be
confounded, though they see another speculation rising from the last,
when I narrate the following incident. A&nbsp;friend who had attentively
gazed at the portrait of Meander, saw me the day after its exhibition.
So, Mr. Delineator, cries he, must you become a dauber in caricature?
One so fond of the zigzag walk in life as you, is hardly entitled to
ridicule deviation in another. I&nbsp;blushed; and the suffusion, like
Corporal Trim’s bow, spoke as plainly as a blush could speak, “my man of
remark, you are perfectly sage in your opinion.” This trivial
circumstance led me to reflect, first on my own inconsistency, and next
on that of others. By exposing the rambles of genius I virtually made
proclamation for dissipation to depart, but she taxed me with issuing
contradictory orders, and pertinently asked how she could go into exile,
when I insisted on her keeping me company? I&nbsp;then looked on my
neighbours. Their characters were
<span class = "pagenum">372b</span>
similar to mine, and they wore not the uniform of regularity more than
myself. Celia, who murders reputations, as “butcher felleth ox”
pronounced, t’other day at a tea-table, a&nbsp;most bitter invective

calumny against her friend. Vafer censorially cautions a young gallant
to beware an indulgence of the licentious passion, but forgets, while
reading his lecture, that he once was amorous, that he solicited the
virgin and the wife, and that, unsatisfied with the ordinary mysteries
of intrigue, he elaborately refined on the system of seduction. Vinoso,

been but twenty these ten years, and who has more wrinkles in her

which was, to lash his poetical brethren for attempting to soar, when
their wings only served them to sink. Yet Pope, after some fine <ins

verses upon Lord Mansfield, fell from a noble height of poetry to the
very bottom of the bathos, by concluding his eulogy with the following
feeble lines,</p>

<p>In the works of Swift, who omits no opportunity of damning dullness,

as he in his wisdom thinketh, a&nbsp;classic writer, censures, in one of

found guilty of turgidity. This pragmatical critic, who heated by
high-church zeal, gives Gibbon to the Devil, and his writings

super-abundance of epithet, though a reader of Knox would suppose that
the favourite page of this pedagogue’s grammar was that which contained
the declension and variation of <i>adjectives</i>. Dr. Beattie, in the
warmth of his wishes to promote social benevolent affections, almost
<i>hates</i> the man, who practices not <i>philanthropy</i>. Rocked in
the cradle of the <i>kirk</i>, and implicitly believing all that the
nurse and priest had taught him, this presbyterian zealot declaims in
terms so acrimonious against the sceptics of the age, that one is led to

employed to preserve&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Juvenal, the ancient satyrist, in one of his virulent attacks on the
reigning Roman follies, avers that the most profligate of the senate
were invariably strenuous advocates for a revival and execution of the
obsolete rigid laws against debauchery. The indignant poet declares that
if such glaring inconsistencies continue, none could be astonished
should Clodius commence railer against libertines, and Cataline be first
to impeach a conspirator. Were a name-sake of this bard to arise,
I&nbsp;should tremble for the sect of modern <i>inconsistents</i>. He
might brandish the lance of satire against such characters with more
justice, though perhaps with less dexterity, than his classic
predecessor. The field of foibles and follies is so fully ripe, that
some one should put in the sickle. In this field appears, and will again
appear, a&nbsp;labourer, who though aukward, may be useful, and who will
be “worthy of his hire,” if he cut up nothing but tares.</p>

<h4>A LETTER OF EXPOSTULATION TO A LADY ON HER MARRIAGE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Your</span> passion, my
dear Mrs. ***, was to be rich, you married a man you despised, and whose
intrinsic worth is <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for centred or centered">centured</ins> in his wealth: which gave
charms even to deformity, transformed Hymen into Mammon, and the god of
love into a satyr. Content yourself then with wealth, enjoy it,
cultivate your taste for those advantages it can produce; and let these
console you for the loss of every thing you have sacrificed for it. Have
recourse to the principles of your determination: you had other offers:
you have therefore examined, compared, chosen, and regretted. Be firm to
this decision of your own judgment, and do not act inconsistently, by
repining that you do not possess what you did not purchase. If the
vices, if the follies of your husband, should become every day more and
more intolerable to you, it will be in vain to regret the tranquility,
the peace, the tender affection, endearing attention, or confidential
intercourse, which might have distinguished your days, had you been
united to a man of merit. In the height of your despair, you exclaim!
“Was it for this, my amiable mother nurtured me with such care, and
cultivated in me, every idea replete with
<span class = "pagenum">373b</span>
honour, enlivened by sentiment, and corrected with tenderness? Alas!
these embellishments do now but add to my misery, in rendering me more
sensible of the wretchedness of my state. The man I am chained to, is so
far from possessing sensibility or taste, that he is dead to every
impression of merit; and modesty, which might have endeared me to a man
of delicacy, renders me hateful to this libertine; who by the indecency
of his discourse, is continually offending against the sensations of a
virtuous mind. While I regret the loss of intellectual enjoyment, my
regret is strengthened by the direful effects of its privation on him.
Mutual esteem is as necessary in a married state, as mutual affection;
neither of which I enjoy. What is pomp, equipage, or splendor, compared
with such seraphic sensations dwelling in the human heart? Will the
blaze of diamonds atone for the deficiency of this passion? Will the
gold of Ophir, melted into one mass, weigh against the raptures of
uniting hearts, warmed with sentiment and truth?”</p>

<p>As this man’s character was known before you married him, can you
have now any just reason of complaint, especially as you have not even
the excuse of partiality to plead for his person? Recollect your own
sordid selfish views; prevailing passion has been gratified, and you
will pardon me, for questioning whether you would relinquish the
advantages of your wealth, to be restored again to your liberty. Miss
Aikin favours us with the following passage from one of Lucian’s
dialogues. “Jupiter complains to Cupid, that though he had so many
intrigues, he was never sincerely beloved: in order to be beloved, says
Cupid, you must lay aside your ægis and your thunderbolts; you must curl
and perfume your hair, place a garland on your head, and walk with a
soft step, and assume a winning obsequious deportment.” “But replied
Jupiter, I&nbsp;am not willing to resign so much of my dignity.” “Then,
returns Cupid, leave off desiring to be loved.” He wanted to be Jupiter
and Adonis at the same time: as you to be rich and happy. What right had
you to expect that a miracle was to be performed in your favour? You
knew well that the wretch to whom you have allied yourself, forsook
humanity, and every genial feeling of an upright and honest heart, in
the acquisition of that fortune, which you wished to possess, and have
obtained, and which has since pampered the vices which disgust you. If
he enumerates the spoils of his victories in &mdash;&mdash;, are they
not covered with the blood of the vanquished? Did he give peace and
happiness to the conquered? Did he accept the gifts of their princes, to
use them for the comfort of those whose fathers, sons, or husbands, were
massacred? Did he use his power to gain security and freedom to the
regions of oppression and slavery? Did he endear the American name by
examples of generosity? Did he return with the consciousness of his duty
discharged to his country, and humanity to his fellow-creatures? If he
was deficient in all this, what manner of right had you to expect
tenderness and affection from him? You might with the same propriety
look for the sensitive plant in a bed of nettles, and then complain you
are stung by
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page374" id = "page374">374</a></span>
them. But you need not be upbraided for the folly of your election,
since your own experience is but too severe a monitor. Debasement is the
child of pride. All that remains for you now, is to render yourself as
easy as possible; it is your duty to soothe the melancholy disposition
your husband will be in (when alone) from a recollection of his crimes.
Perhaps, by using your influence judiciously, you may yet have it in
your power to humanize his passions, and refine his pleasures: but your
good sense will tell you that there is so much pride interwoven in the
heart of man, that his obstinacy will never condescend to receive any
more than a hint from a wife. A&nbsp;husband is more likely to be
praised into virtue, than rallied out of vice; and the most essential
point in the art of leading others, is to conceal from them that they
are led at all. If he reforms, and thinks the world gives him the credit
of it, in a short time he will believe it proceeded from his own will
and inclinations, which will insure his constancy in it. Every method is
laudable on your part, to reclaim your husband, except an affectation of
fondness for him: this would be a profanation of love: and a woman
capable of such abject deceit, I&nbsp;should look upon as capable of the
most determined baseness. If his crimes have hardened him, it will be in
vain for you to attempt his reformation: but while you lament his
depravity, you are left at liberty to spend your own time as you think
proper. The gratifications of society, and the secrecy of solitude, are
now equally in your power; please yourself and be content. If gaiety and
dissipation are your pursuits, it cannot be denied that they are slight
counterpoises for domestic felicity: but as the latter is entirely out
of your reach, you should endeavour to make yourself easy. It is your
own judgment alone that must lead you to obtaining that tranquility,
which you may possibly find in the exulting joy of succouring virtue in
distress, merit in indigence and obscurity; in wiping tears from the
eyes of affliction, and in making the widow’s heart leap for joy. The
serene complacency which springs in a good mind, on the exertion of
benevolent principles, cannot be described; like the peace of God, it
passeth knowledge. The poet says,</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>It is a joy possess’d by few indeed!</p>
<p>Dame Fortune has so many fools to feed,</p>
<p>She cannot oft afford, with all her store,</p>
<p>To yield her smiles, where nature smil’d before.</p>
<p>To sinking worth a cordial hand to lend;</p>
<p>With better Fortune to surprise a friend;</p>
<p>To chear the modest stranger’s lonely state;</p>
<p>Or snatch an orphan family from fate:</p>
<p>To do, possess’d with virtue’s noblest fire,</p>
<p>Such gen’rous deeds, as we with tears admire.</p>

<p class = "right">ARMSTRONG.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus you may evince the reality of your feelings, whilst it is in
vain for others in less affluent circumstances to manifest their
benevolence as they wish. Thus also, may you turn your husband’s
(ill-acquired) perishable goods of fortune, into real blessings.</p>

<p>Wealth not only gilds the present moments as they pass; but like the
sun, constantly supplies those rays which cherish all on whom they fall,
and constitute an uninterrupted
<span class = "pagenum">374b</span>
series of felicity in the bosom of that person from whom they proceed:
whilst, on the contrary, the weight of poverty not only distresses a
person for the present, but may perhaps prevent him from emerging into
happiness, and others from participating of that benevolence, which
warrants the means of exemplifying its sincerity. What must the poor man
suffer, when the eye of friendship becomes inverted by his misfortunes
in the world, and where he looks in vain around him for the benevolence
of sympathy, and the consolations of human attachment!</p>

Scrip, late of ’Change Alley, Cornhill, Stockbroker. During the course
of a long life he was diligent, industrious, and indefatigable in the
exercise of his profession. He died in the seventieth year of his age,
and <i>died well</i>, having left behind him a fortune of sixty thousand
pounds sterling. It is however much to be regretted, that, <i>stocks
being shut</i> at the time of his death, he was not able to make a
<i>transfer</i>, or carry any part of it to his <i>account</i> in the
other world. It was remarked of him, that he was always more solicitous
to get the <i>turn of the day</i> to himself, than to do a <i>good
turn</i> to his neighbour; and that though he frequently made bargains
<i>for time</i>, he did not choose to risk any thing <i>for
eternity</i>. He never gave money to the poor, though offered a very
high <i>premium</i>, thinking it safer to make <i>ten per cent.</i> in
the <i>English funds</i>, than <i>ten thousand</i> in those of a
<i>foreign country</i>. For these reasons, though he was always esteemed
<i>a good man</i> at Jonathan’s, it is much to be dreaded, that, at the

had bedecked the east with his golden beams, and the major part of
mankind were pleased with the prospect. But the hero of this piece had
enjoyed none of its enlivening rays, since he had been exiled from the
world, until this morning: The gratings of the locks, and opening of the
doors which secured the entrance into his cell, roused him to reflect
that perhaps this was the day on which his fate was to be decided: his
conjectures were right; he was to be tried this day by the laws of his
country.</p>

<p>The attendants on the court had now penetrated into the place of his
confinement, and the smith was set to work in loosening his fetters.
Owing to the length of time, and their not being sufficiently large, the
skin adhered thereto; and on their being knocked off, it accompanied
them. Indeed, if there had been present one disinterested person, he
would have inferred that a barbarous punishment, formerly practiced by
eastern monarchs, had found entrance into a civilized country.</p>

<p>Being now freed from the galling irons, the culprit, safely guarded
by the officers of justice, was in a few minutes conducted before her
<i>impartial</i> seat.</p>

<p>In due time, and in the usual form, did the stern dispenser of
justice commence the solemn interrogatory of “<i>Guilty, or not
Guilty?</i>” As the prisoner had duly weighed in his own breast the
answer he was to make, in an audible voice he replied in the
negative.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;Say not, misjudging mortal, that this unfortunate being
was to blame in what he uttered, for truth dropped from his lips. True,
indeed, his hand, guided by desperation, had done the deed. Despair,
that haggard fiend, actuated every feeling; reason had deserted his
breast&mdash;The man was entirely annihilated. At this juncture his hand
had perpetrated what his heart would have abhorred to have thought
on.&mdash;Call this not sophistry, ye, who hold to the mild precepts of
christianity; consider it well, and then let unbiased reason have its
full scope.</p>

<p>The council for the prosecution set forth in its blackest colours the
dreadful nature of the crime of murder; and concluded with assuring the
jury, that unless they brought the prisoner in guilty, they would act
contrary to every law, human and divine.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;The prisoner had no one to speak for
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The learned Judge proceeded to give his opinion, in which it can

<p>A verdict was returned, agreeable to the wish of the court, which
being done, sentence was passed in usual form,
<span class = "pagenum">375b</span>
not forgetting, at the close, to entreat the compassion of the Deity. It
seemed to breathe forth pity, but it was only the semblance; and the

<h4>INTENT OF RELIGION.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">If</span> there be any
principle fully ascertained by religion, it is, that this life was
intended for a state of trial and improvement to man. His preparation
for a better world required a gradual purification, carried on by steps
of progressive discipline. The situation here assigned him was such as
to answer this design, by calling forth all his active powers, by giving
full scope to his moral dispositions, and bringing to light his whole
character. Hence it became proper, that difficulty and temptation should
arise in the course of his duty; ample rewards were promised to virtue;
but these rewards were left, as yet, in obscurity and distant
prospect.</p>

<p>The impressions of sense were so balanced against immortality, as to
allow a conflict between faith and sense,&mdash;between conscience and
desire,&mdash;between present pleasure and future good. In this conflict
the souls of good men are tried, improved and strengthened:&mdash;in
this field their honours are reaped;&mdash;here are formed the capital
virtues of fortitude, temperance, and self-denial;&mdash;moderation in
prosperity, patience in adversity, submission to the will of God,
charity and forgiveness to men amidst the various competitions of
worldly interest.</p>


<p class = "twin w14">&nbsp;</p>

<h4>HOPE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Hope</span> to the soul,
when distracted by the confusions of the world, is as an anchor to a
ship in a dark night, on an unknown coast, and amidst a boisterous
ocean. In danger it gives security;&mdash;amidst general fluctuation it
affords one fixed point of rest. It is the most eminent of all the
advantages which religion confers. It is the universal
comforter;&mdash;it is the spring of all human activity.</p>

<p>Upon futurity, men are constantly suspended; animated by the prospect
of some distant good, they toil and suffer through the whole course of
life; and it is not so much what they are at present, as what they hope
to be in some after time, that enlivens their motions, fixes their
attention, and stimulates industry.</p>

<p>Was this hope entertained with that full persuasion which Christian
faith demands, it would in truth totally annihilate all human miseries;
it would banish discontent, extinguish grief, and suspend the very
feeling of pain.</p>

<h4>HUMILITY IN COMPANY.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Of</span> all the
qualifications for conversation, humility, if not the most brilliant, is
the safest, the most amiable, and the most feminine. The affectation of
introducing subjects with which others are unacquainted, and of
displaying talents superior to the rest of the company, is as dangerous
as it is foolish.</p>

<p>There are many who never can forgive another for being more agreeable
and more accomplished than themselves, and who can pardon any offence
rather than an eclipsing merit. The fable of the nightingale should be
ever had in remembrance, as it conveys a most useful lesson replete with
valuable instructions. Had the silly warbler conquered his vanity, and
resisted the temptation of shewing a fine voice, he might have escaped
the talons of the hawk. The melody of his singing was the cause of his
destruction; his merit brought him into danger, and his vanity cost him
his life.</p>

<h4>MAN’S DANGER AND SECURITY IN YOUTH.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> that period of
life too often characterized by forward presumption and headlong
pursuit, self-conceit is the great source of those dangers to which men
are exposed; and it is peculiarly unfortunate, that the age which stands
most in need of the counsel of the wise, should be the most prone to
contemn it. Confident in the opinions which they adopt, and in the
measures which they pursue, the bliss which youth aim at is, in their
opinion, fully apparent. It is not the danger of mistake, but the
failure of success, which they dread. Activity to seize, not sagacity to
discern, is the only requisite which they value.</p>

<p>The whole state of nature is now become a scene of delusion to the
sensual mind. Hardly any thing is what it appears to be: and what
flatters most is always farthest from reality. There are voices which
sing around us, but whose strains allure to ruin. There is a banquet
spread where poison is in every dish. There is a couch which invites us
to repose, but to slumber upon it is death. Sobriety should temper
unwary ardour; Modesty check rash presumption; Wisdom be the offspring
of reflection now, rather than the bitter fruit of experience
hereafter.</p>

<h5><i>HISTORY OF CAPTAIN S&mdash;&mdash;.</i></h5>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">She</span> arrived at the
house of Mrs. Moore, and on enquiring for Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;, was
answered by a coarse, vulgar-looking woman, that “she know’d no such
person; but that she was a stranger, and her mistress was out.” Mrs.
Wilmot was not to be so easily repulsed after her morning’s fatigue; and
on her mentioning the child, the woman added, “Oh, to be sure, she meant
the grand lady that had supped there the night before, after she had
been to the play; for that she had lighted her home, and would tell the
coachman where she lived.”</p>

<p>Thus directed, they proceeded near half a mile farther; from whence
Mrs. Wilmot would have been probably sent back as much in the dark, had
not the sudden appearance of Mrs. <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> at an upper window caught her eye, and
there was no possibility of denying herself. Mrs. Wilmot ordered the
coachman, without much ceremony, to open the door, but knocked
repeatedly at that of the house before she was let in. She was at length
shewn into a sumptuous parlour where every thing bespoke luxury, and
Mrs. <span class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> came to her. Her
visible confusion, and the style of her dress so different to that in
which Mrs. Wilmot had been accustomed to behold her, would have soon
convinced a person of less penetration than that worthy woman, of the
deception practised on her master.</p>

<p>“Without making any comments, she delivered her message, and
earnestly intimated that the little boy might return with her; to which
Mrs. <span class = "locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> most reluctantly
assented. They were soon seated in the coach, and Mrs. Wilmot thought it
her duty to forbear interrogating the child; but confined herself to her
own pious reflections on that gentle pity which she thought it necessary
for every human being to bestow on the lost young creature, from whom
she had just parted. She wished it had not been reserved for her to make
the discovery of unquestionable guilt; and while she contemplated the
sweet features of the lovely boy, she inwardly ejaculated a prayer to
his Creator, that his young mind might remain uncontaminated by bad
example; for she could not suppose that at such early years he could be
an adept in the school of deception; or that a mother, though lost in
her own person, could train up her child in the paths that led to infamy
and corruption. Alas, his little heart was already less pure than her
own; and he was an able practitioner in the art of dissembling.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">378b</span>
<p>“Mrs. Wilmot’s silence lasted no longer than till her return home;
when immediately requesting a few minutes private audience with her
master in his study, she, with many apologies, entered into a full
explanation of what she had seen, and what she conjectured.</p>

<p>“When dinner was over, my uncle questioned Frederick; and was
astonished at the hardened resolution with which he at first
equivocated. On finding, however, that his secret had transpired, and
his interrogator was resolved, the weakness of a mind not yet
sufficiently strong to be consummate in hypocrisy, betrayed him, and he
revealed all he knew.</p>

<p>Shocked at the idea of suffering the child to return to his imprudent
mother, yet not possessing in himself sufficient authority to detain
him, there was but one expedient, and that was to send for me. He drew
from him a promise not to mention to his mother a word of what had
passed; and promising to him if he did not, such presents as were most
desirable at his age, he sent him home; and it was the day following on
which, at his own request, I&nbsp;waited on him.</p>

<p>Our conversation was such as might be expected, and I had the
happiness to see myself restored to a relation, whom I had hitherto
scarcely known. He invited me to reside at his house; and in a few days
his attorney waited on Mrs. <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> with a formal requisition, in my behalf,
for the restoration of my son. She complied by force, but had the
littleness to take from him all his wearing apparel, save that in which
he sullenly appeared before us. My emotions on seeing him cannot be
described. He received my caresses with disgust; and seemed to consider
us both more as his tyrants than his protectors. For several weeks we
tried what effect kindness, little presents, and the partaking of
different amusements, would have on his mind. None of these succeeded;
his temper was vindictive, stubborn, morose, and even revengeful. He
never spoke of his mother, and we as carefully avoided her name in his
presence. We fitted up without his knowledge a small room in the house
for his use, and stored it with such books as might amuse his fancy, and
instruct his mind. No act of kindness made any impression on him. Often
did the unmanly tear roll silently down my cheek, as I traced the
distant, but well-finished resemblance of his lovely mother. He
frequently observed me as my heart yearned to embrace him, but his
ungracious looks repelled the too tender emotion. My uncle at length
told me of his determination to send him to school, and hinted at the
same time his intentions in his favour. We soon after placed him at an
academy ten miles from town, and had the pleasure to receive very
satisfactory accounts of his conduct and improvements. We seldom
visited, or sent for him, but at the time of the general holidays; as
from that mistaken indulgence arises so frequently a love of pleasure
and idleness, and a disgust to all which should be materially attended
to. He wrote, at my express desire, to his mother, to inform her of his
new situation, and of the orders which had been given to prevent any
interruption of his studies; but this caution proved needless, as she
neither answered his letter, nor took any farther notice of him.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page379" id = "page379">379</a></span>
<p>I passed about two years in this state of negative happiness, when
death suddenly robbed me of my valuable relation; a&nbsp;misfortune the
more grievous, as it was wholly unexpected. The physician who
occasionally attended him had not perceived any alarming symptoms; and a
few mornings after his last visit, Mrs. Wilmot found him dead in his
bed. He was a man of sound morals, but great eccentricity. He had been
so long estranged from the world, and those few who had any claim of
relationship, that ’tis probable he would have left his possessions for
the use of public charities, had not Mrs. <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>, without intending to serve me,
so materially effected&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>As it was not unusual for my uncle to pass several days together in
his own apartment, during which I seldom or ever saw him, I&nbsp;had no
idea till Mrs. Wilmot suggested to me her opinion that a new will had
been lately made. Mr. Term, the lawyer, whom he had employed to bring my
son to us, and in whom he had always appeared to place much confidence,
had been latterly more frequent than usual in his visits; and Mrs.
Wilmot was afterwards justified in her opinion that her master had been
guided by him in the regulation of his affairs. I&nbsp;sent immediately
for that gentleman, and we proceeded into the gloomy chamber of death,
where we had no difficulty to find the object of our search. He opened
and read it to us. We found that he had left the bulk of his fortune to
my son; an annuity of two hundred pounds to myself; and to Mrs. Wilmot,
his houshold furniture, plate, and other articles, besides fifty pounds
a year for her life. Mr. Term was his sole executor; and I had no cause
to be displeased with the choice. He appointed that gentleman and myself
the joint guardians of Frederick. Mrs. <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span> was not mentioned, but some
trifling sums were bequeathed to different people.</p>

<p>“We found on investigation, that after discharging these
incumbrances, my son’s property would not exceed from seven to eight
thousand pounds. When the funeral was over, I&nbsp;took lodgings in the
neighbourhood; and my son, whom I had sent for on that occasion,
returned to his school. I&nbsp;had not been there many days, before I
received a letter from Doctor <span class =
"locked">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>, his worthy preceptor, informing me that
Frederick had suddenly disappeared; and that in so secret a manner, that
none of the boys, whom he had severally questioned, could give the least
intimation of his design. I&nbsp;immediately waited on Mr. Term, and
invested him with full power over him, desiring him to act for me as
well as himself.</p>

<p>“We had no doubt of his mother’s being privy to his flight; but
though she did not deny having any knowledge of him, it was impossible
to prevail on her to reveal what she had done with him. We gave up the
pursuit; and, though I could not be happy, I&nbsp;endeavoured to be
composed.</p>

<p>“I knew that my re-union with my wife was now beyond the reach of
possibility. Dear, and undeserving as she was, I&nbsp;could only pity,
and lament her. I&nbsp;knew too that she must be inevitably wretched;
for though I was well assured she had a settlement nearly double to my
income, yet I was equally so that no provision, however splendid, could
compensate
<span class = "pagenum">379b</span>
for the loss of every social virtue, and the self-accusation of perfidy,
and ingratitude.</p>

<p>“In a few months, she sent me an insulting letter; telling me, that
as she knew her son’s fortune to be out of the reach of his guardians,
she could be under no apprehensions for his future welfare; but that of
his present conduct she should take charge; which, if we objected to,
would oblige her to continue silent respecting his residence. We soon,
however, without any difficulty, found out that he was at a respectable
military academy; and as we could not suggest any reasonable motives for
withdrawing him, unless it was to prevent him from seeing his mother,
which we knew would drive them both to extremities, we were silent on
the subject; and, at length, answered the different bills that were
necessarily contracted for his support and education.</p>

<p>“My son is now in his twenty-fifth year, and has been nearly nine in
a regiment of foot, at this time in Ireland. For my present poverty,
I&nbsp;can only alledge, that dangerous rock on which all my peace has
been wrecked, a&nbsp;too large portion of <i>natural affection</i>. His
unbounded extravagance has reduced me to distress; and I have taken up,
at different times, to assist him, sums so inadequate to my
circumstances, that some years must pass before I can enjoy anew that
comfortable independance, which was forfeited almost as soon as
acquired!</p>

<p>“Of Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; I know nothing. Time has blunted the sharp
edge of grief; but the wound has penetrated my heart, and <i>that</i>
will never know a <i>cure</i>.</p>

<p>“My son knows I can do no more for him, and leaves me to my fate.
Thus is every balsamic drop that is mixed in the full cup of human woe,
converted into deadly poison; the more fatal to me, as they issue from
the fount that flowed pure and unadulterated from the hands of its
Creator.</p>

<p>“Thus, Madam, have you patiently attended to the undisguised story of
a poor, unfortunate old man, worn out by sorrow more than by years;
a&nbsp;man, who has been a friend, though an unsuccessful one, to human
nature, but who is now become a burden to himself, and to the
World.”</p>

<p>I pitied him&mdash;I wept with him:&mdash;But it is reserved to the
High Power alone whom he worships, to administer consolation.</p>

<p>Should the eyes of youth, and levity, be cast over the preceding
history, may they be moistened by the tear of Sensibility! And may the
heart of every child that is callous to the distresses of a parent,
recoil with horror at the unnatural crime; and, by returning to his
duty, fulfil <i>the great Commandment of Heaven!</i></p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">It</span> would scarcely
inform my readers to assure them, that, when I was at College, my
mathematical tutor shook his head, and dubbed me a stupid fellow.
Whatever stress might be laid on the multiplication and pence tables by
the sedate shop-keepers of State-street and Cornhill, it always appeared
to me that a scholar could attain the object of his mission to the
university, without any assistance from the four first rules. Hence,
I&nbsp;was more ashamed to be surprised solving a sum in Pike, than a
reputed virgin would be to have the unchaste poems of <i>Rochester</i>
plucked from her pillow. I&nbsp;contented myself with studying the ways
of men and the works of Roman and English wits, without gaping with a
foolish face of wonder, when told of the “Square of the Hypothenuse,”
and the miracles that compound interest would perform in a term of
years. Geometrical progression was not half so delightful to me as
vehicular progression in a crazy Charlestown-car. That portion of
arithmetic among merchants called fellowship, or company, I&nbsp;left to
them to ascertain their shares of a cargo of sugar and molasses by;
while the rules of good fellowship I made familiar both to my conception
and practice. In fine, those of my prudent friends who observed the
lankness of my purse, long before the expiration of a College term,
merrily remarked, that <span class = "smallroman">REDUCTION</span> was
the only part of arithmetic in which I made a figure.</p>

<p>This avowed neglect of a darling study, so offended the lovers of
straight lines, that every moment they could steal from their diagrams
they employed in prognosticating my future fortune. They would sketch on
the paper covers of <span class = "smallcaps">Euclid</span> perspective
views of my dilapidated estate; and by rhombus, rhomboid, and trapezium,
barbarous terms, such as are “a&nbsp;misery to hear,” they would conjure
away my goods and chattles. Those, who descending from the heights of
abstraction, condescended to become mere mortals again, and to converse
upon sublunary topics, were continually quoting and applying to me that
elegant adage “of bringing one’s noble to a nine-pence,” &amp;c. In vain
I endeavoured to defend my practice, and to apologize for my disbelief
in Euclid’s <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘infalibility’">infallibility</ins>. In vain I suggested, that many of
the brightest geniuses successfully clambered up the rugged steeps of
Fame, without employing the nine digits, as pioneers, to smooth the way:
that Shakespeare, with whom, as Cicero observes of Plato, I&nbsp;would
rather <i>err</i>, than think right with all the philosophers, was not
only a novice in the doctrine of “nought and carry one,” but frankly
indulges a laugh of contempt at computation:&mdash;that in Othello, when
Iago informs his Venitian dupe of
<span class = "pagenum">380b</span>
Cassio’s unjust preferment to a lieutenancy, and is asked “what is he?”
the contemptuous response is “forsooth a great arithmetician!” That in
Love’s Labour Lost, a&nbsp;pert page demands of Armado “how many is one
thrice told?” the solemn knight replies “I&nbsp;am ill at reckoning, it
fits the spirit of a tapster:” that Lord Lyttleton the elder,
a&nbsp;<i>man of business</i>, emphasizing the phrase, honoured by his
prince with a place in the exchequer and in the department of finance,
could not, as we are assured by his son, count twenty pounds in
different British coins; that the Dean of St. Patrick’s, whose sterling
sense and humour has pleased and informed men more than all the works of
all the mathematicians, employed eight hours in a day in reading
historians and poets, and composing the Tale of a Tub, and was refused
by the university of Dublin, a&nbsp;degree, because he lampooned Locke
and derided the ærial speculations of a mathematician. All these shining
examples, like Haman’s prosperity, “availed me nothing,” and the
sticklers for science told me that I could not give directions to a
carpenter without understanding&mdash;how shall I write so unpoetical a
word&mdash;without understanding <i>parallelograms</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus far, in jocular phrase, discussed this <i>grave</i>
subject, I&nbsp;now seriously declare, it is not my wish to abrogate any
branches of this recondite science. I&nbsp;am not possessed with such a
Quixotish spirit of innovation, as to desire all concerned forthwith to
make proclamation for mathematics and cousin german arithmetic to
depart; but good-naturedly to deride that mode of education, which
neglecting, or partially studying, eloquence, poetry, history, the
classics, and the world, devotes long and exclusive attention to things
abstracted and foreign from men’s business and bosoms. That great and
universal scholar, Dr. Johnson, whose authority is of no trivial weight,
decisively pronounces that this science and the knowledge which it
requires and includes, is not the great and frequent business of life.
It is of rare emergence. We are perpetually moralists, but we are
geometricians only by chance. One may live long with a man and not
discern his skill in hydrostatics, or astronomy, but his moral and
prudential character immediately appears. The rigid Knox, who is a
strenuous advocate for the severest school discipline, confesses, that a
man may be very liberally educated, without much skill in this branch of
learning. I&nbsp;remember reading, not many years since, a&nbsp;preface
of Dr. Cheyne’s to one of his medical tracts, wherein, after describing
his devotion to triangles, &amp;c. he pathetically deplores his waste of
time, and adds, “that in these exquisitely bewitching speculations,
gentlemen of liberal leisure may riot; but for men of general learning,
business, and the world, they are too empty and ærial.” My readers will
perhaps yawn at these multiplied citations; but this is a science,
supported so much by authority and opinion, that I must oppose it with
equal arms.</p>

<p>We are magisterially told that this study, <i>of all others</i>, most
closely fixes the attention. An argument shallow, untrue, and easily
vanquished. Any object that engrosses the mind, will induce a habit of
attention. Now I can warrantably
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page381" id = "page381">381</a></span>
assert, that a description from Virgil, a&nbsp;scene from Shakespeare,
Robertson’s narrative of the decollation of Mary, or any striking
passage from authors of polite literature, will accomplish this purpose.
Why should the demonstrations of Euclid arrogate this honour to
themselves? Have they an <i>exclusive privilege</i> of enchanting the
mind, or are they invested with a talismanic charm by which attention is
at once conjured into mathematical circles? Addison wondered how
<i>rational</i> beings could for hours play with painted bits of paper;
but he was manifestly a novice in whist, a&nbsp;game which, regularly
played, is an unremitting exercise of two of the noblest intellectual
powers, memory and judgment. The acute Hume, when jaded with
metaphysical research, invigorated his powers with a cheerful <span
class = "smallroman">RUBBER</span>. From a fashionable amusement he
derived that benefit which the worshippers of Euclid would confine to
their God. In fine, a&nbsp;<i>mere</i> mathematician, without being a
more cogent reasoner, is less learned, less eloquent, and less courtly
than the Beauclercs, whose superficial talents he contemns. He is a
solemn, absent, unaccommodating mortal. Better therefore to imitate
Cardinal de Retz and Chesterfield; better to study the useful and the
pleasant, than to dream away life over the symbols and negative
quantities of algebra.</p>

<p>I proposed to animadvert next on the influence that arithmetical
minutiæ gradually obtained over the heart. I&nbsp;was about adventuring
to censure even the great Dr. Franklin, for insisting too much upon the
mint, annise, and cummin of computation. I&nbsp;wished to brand avarice,
and to deny the doctrine of “uttermost farthings.” But I recollected
that every penurious parent, who prescribes as a horn-book lesson to his
son, that “scoundrel maxim” a&nbsp;penny saved is a penny got, would
cry&mdash;shame! The world, quoth prudence, will not bear it; ’tis a
penny getting, pound hoarding world&mdash;I yielded; and shelter myself
in my garret against that mob of misers and worldlings I see gathering
to hoot&nbsp;me.</p>

<h4>REFLECTIONS ON SCANDAL.</h4>

<hr class = "w075">

<p>“Base Envy withers at another’s joy,</p>
<p>And hates that excellence it cannot reach.”</p>

</div>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">There</span> is not a
greater enemy to the peace of individuals, and society at large, than
Scandal; although it is much to be regretted, that, there is no frailty
to which most people are so subject. Scandal is the offspring of Envy;
and the only weapon of little minds against superior abilities. But
notwithstanding Scandal affects, more or less, every member of the
community, it reigns with more distinguished power over some parts of
society than others. On enquiry, it will appear that the female
character sustains the most injury from this bane to human happiness. In
the country, too, this species of Scandal is more prevalent than in the
<span class = "pagenum">381b</span>
metropolis. The reason is obvious; in a country place, the number of
inhabitants are so small, that each is frequently more acquainted with
the character of his neighbour than his own. Every action is examined
with the most critical severity; and often the best of characters lose
the esteem of their acquaintance from the malignant aspersions of
Ignorance and Envy. It is impossible for a lady to be seen walking with
a gentleman, in such a place, without the immediate conclusion that they
are lovers: it is even not uncommonly added, if their acquaintance
should have lasted any length of time, that Miss Such-a-one appears to
be in <i>fair way</i>. After a report of this nature has once spread,
I&nbsp;have seen a company of females thrown into the greatest
consternation, by the entrance of a lady who was the unfortunate subject
of Slander. How busy is the silent whisper, on these occasions! It runs
with amazing rapidity, from ear to ear, accompanied by nods and winks;
with a&mdash;“You know who”&mdash;“So they say”&mdash;“Well,
I&nbsp;could never have thought it!” and a variety of such phrases,
which every one must at some time have heard.</p>

<p>Scandal is of a quality peculiarly distressing. Against the open
shafts of violence, every one may defend himself; but, from Slander, and
secret Calumny, the most deserving must suffer.</p>

<p>The only method to prevent this pest to society, is for every one to
shut their ears against the officious tales of Scandal and Envy; since
experience proves, that if people in general were not too much inclined
to listen, when any account is brought of the faults and failings of
others, the tongue of Scandal would no longer find the mean satisfaction
it now enjoys.</p>

<p>The mischiefs that accrue to mankind, from Calumny and Slander, are
innumerable. How many families have their peace destroyed by evil
reports! By such means, the seeds of enmity are too often engendered
between the dearest connections in life.</p>

<p>It has already been observed, that Scandal is the only weapon of
little minds against superior worth and abilities. The truth of this
remark ought to be a sufficient preventative; for, I&nbsp;believe, no
one would wish to incur the merited appellation of a little and envious
mind. Females, in particular, should divest themselves of this spirit,
which produces so many evils among the fair-sex; for, let it be
remembered, that an envious mind, and slanderous tongue, never inhabit
the face of beauty, and the form of elegance!&mdash;If there must still
remain, in the breasts of some, a&nbsp;slanderous spirit, and a delight
to fabricate scandalous reports; if most people will also retain a
propensity to hear whatever comes from such a source; let us act with
some degree of impartiality: before we credit, as undoubted truth, tales
injurious so the reputation of another; we ought, at least, to examine
whether what we hear does not wear the most flagrant marks of falsehood.
Thus we may often be enabled to discover fiction from truth, and be
satisfied that the person accused is entirely innocent: and it is the
province of great minds, to vindicate the characters of those who are
absent, when unjustly aspersed by the tongue of Scandal.</p>

<h4>CHARACTER OF LORD MOUNT-GARTH.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Of</span> the following
extraordinary character, though not given as historical fact, there is
said to have actually been a prototype lately, if not at present,
resident in one of the wildest parts of the county of Suffolk.</p>

<p>Lord Mount-Garth had retired from the world twenty years ago, not
only within his own park, but, except on very rare occasions, within his
own palace and garden; which, together, occupied a space of nearly a
square mile, and were surrounded by a wall fifteen feet high; against
which he would amuse himself for hours in playing at hand-ball;
sometimes alone, and at others accompanied by a female favourite, the
only person he would suffer to come near him, or could ever bear to see,
though at a distance, except one man, the son of his father’s gardener,
who had been brought up with him at home from his infancy, and was
exactly of the same age, being born in the same night and hour. This man
had not, any more than his lordship, been without the precincts of the
park, and very seldom beyond those of the garden, for the space of
thirty years. As they went into this state of voluntary confinement,
which is a kind of <i>internal</i> exile, at the age of twenty, they are
now, of course, in the fiftieth year of their age. John, for that was
the name of the man, had been educated along with his lordship in his
father’s family, by a private tutor; and had acquired a competent
knowledge, not only of ancient and modern languages, history, and Belles
Lettres, but a general idea of the principles and progressive
improvement in the arts and sciences. John acted in the capacity of
valet de chambre, confidant, and companion; dined at the same table with
his lordship, went to bed at the same hour, and slept to the same hour
precisely, and almost to the same minute rose in the morning. He was
dressed precisely in the same kind of cloaths, even to the sameness of
shoe-buckles and sleeve-buttons. If my lord felt himself not very well,
and judged it proper to take any medicine, John must take the same
medicine also. “John” he would say, “I&nbsp;think we sat up rather too
late last night: I&nbsp;think we should not be the worse for an
emetic.”&mdash;“I think we should be much the better for it, my
lord.”&mdash;“John, I&nbsp;am afraid we have rather exceeded in our
refreshments for some days past: I&nbsp;think we should be none the
worse for some cathartics.”&mdash;“I think we should be much the better
for them, my lord.”&mdash;“John, I&nbsp;think we feel somewhat of a
vertigo this morning: I&nbsp;think we should be not the worse for a
little sal volatile.”&mdash;“I think we should be much the better for
it, my lord.”&mdash;“Have we not felt a somewhat of relaxation of nerves
for same days, John?”&mdash;“I protest, my lord, on recollection,
I&nbsp;think we have.”&mdash;<ins class = "correction"
title = "open quote missing">“What</ins> should you think of a dip in the
cold-bath?”&mdash;“I think, my lord, it would do us both a great deal of
good.”</p>

<p>This singular character, sunk in indolence and sensuality, of all
things dreaded cold: but as for snow, he could not
<span class = "pagenum">382b</span>
endure the sight of it. In winter, he generally lay in bed till ten or
eleven o’clock: about that time he would pull his bell, call for John,
and ask him what kind of a day it was. “It is a very fine day, my lord;
the sun shines out brightly, and the atmosphere is unsullied by a
cloud.”&mdash;“Why, then, John, I&nbsp;think we should be the better for
a race in the garden.” For it was their custom to have frequent races,
at the end of which both parties were within a few feet of each other.
“John, how looks the weather this morning?”&mdash;“Most hideously, my
lord! The sky lowers; the feathered creation retreat to their roosts;
the cats incessantly curry their hides; and flakes of snow, driving
before the wind, announce the coming storm.”&mdash;“John, shut the doors
and windows; light up a rouzing fire; let candles be brought; let the
pastry and cold tongues be laid on the table; and, since it is a bad
day, let us make a good night.”</p>

<p>Many efforts were made by the college acquaintance of his lordship to
see him; for, with all his singularities, he was an amiable and
benevolent man, as well as an excellent scholar; and attached, as by a
singular charm, all his acquaintance to his person. They would put up
their horses at an adjoining village, and send letters to his lordship,
fraught with recollections of former intimacy. His lordship never failed
to return answers replete with equal kindness; recollecting former
scenes and circumstances, with expressions of the most pleasing
emotions, but always declining any personal interview.</p>

<p>As the inn nearest his lordship’s park was but a very wretched
one&mdash;for in this sequestered spot there was no encouragement for a
good one&mdash;he took care always to send, on the arrival of strangers,
the best provisions of all kinds, unknown to his friends, with orders to
the landlord to make some trifling charge, lest he should offend their
delicacy, by affording them entertainment when he refused them his
company. His lordship’s friend was a good sort of woman: she amused
herself, now and then, by giving suppers to the servants and the farmers
daughters in the neighbourhood, the nearest house being five miles from
the Castle. He had land stewards on his different estates; all business
with whom, as with every other mortal, was transacted through the medium
of John, or the housekeeper. If he had occasion to go from one quarter
of the castle or garden to another, orders were previously sent to all
the servants to keep out of the way; for, if he had catched any of them
looking at him, he would have immediately dismissed them from his
service. He had an excellent library, in which he passed a great part of
his time, but into which no publication of any kind had been admitted
since the year of his retirement, or sequestration from the world; being
that, as already mentioned, on which he left the university, having then
succeeded to the estate by the death of his father. No newspapers! no
magazines! no reviews! no political pamphlets! no annual registers! No,
nor any conversation concerning any political or other event that had
happened in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page383" id = "page383">383</a></span>
Britain, or any other part of the world, from the hour of his seclusion.
He turned himself about, and cast his eyes backward, and fixed them
wholly on former times. Although, he confessed, that he had often been
tempted to enquire what could be the causes of the sudden and enormous
accumulation of taxes.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">&mdash;First</span> marched
forth those that guarded the law from violation; then followed the
culprit bound in a cart, attended by a clergyman, who was using his
pious endeavours to smooth the passage into another world. They reached
the tree. The ladder was placed, and after a few minutes spent in the
solemn duties of religion, he ascended it. With the consciousness of a
heart in which every virtue glowed, and with a fortitude which the
virtuous only possess, he calmly surveyed the surrounding multitude, and
signified his wish to be heard: they eagerly lent their attention, while
he painted to them the cause of his disgrace, and the misery of his
family which had led him to the act. He said he could not endure the
idea of seeing them perish before his eyes; and when their distress was
at its highest pitch, and when he could get no help from those who would
have befriended him with all they were worth when he needed it not, he
had sallied forth on the highway, determined to alleviate their
distresses&mdash;but his intentions were not to shed blood&mdash;driven
to desperation by experiencing a refusal, (when on his knees he
solicited the boon) he had done the deed.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The people were all attention, and when he ended, their streaming
eyes spoke the sentiments of their hearts.</p>

<p>The moments were precious. The cord was fastened to the wood, and
after a few moments spent in devotion, the curtain of life dropped.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the solemn scene closed, when a murmur was heard among
the croud, and shortly after a female rushed to the spot. It was his
wife. Heavens! what a shock for her delicate frame! She had but just
recovered from an illness she had fallen into when they had dragged her
husband from her arms. She saw him now when life sat quivering at his
lips, and then in unison their spirits ascended to that bright world of
bliss.</p>

dreadful crime of murder? Does his death restore to life the person
murdered? Does it allay the grief of the distressed
family?&mdash;&mdash;No!&mdash;&mdash;What then is it that makes you
give your tacit consent to a measure which is hostile to every principle
of equity&mdash;derogatory to every principle of humanity? Is it because
this severe law was first given in thunderings, from Mount <ins class =

while beholding with their eyes the glory of the Deity, yet worshipped
the work of their own hands? Throw aside prejudice, and that fellest
tyranny, <i>custom</i>, until then you will never view things in their
proper sphere.</p>

<p>Would not solitary imprisonment in a lonely cell, far excluded from
every pitying eye, for a term of years, be more just? He might be
compelled to labor, and his earnings go to maintain the family which
through his means has lost its support. Thus they who have suffered by
his misconduct might reap some advantage: whereas, by taking his life
they must be left to pine in want and wretchedness. If after continuing
in this state for some years, it be discovered that a thorough change is
wrought, and the offender has become a reasonable creature, then let him
be discharged&mdash;the debt is fully paid. But should he after this
again imbrue his hands in the blood of his fellow men, then let rigorous
imprisonment for life be the penalty&mdash;he is no longer fit to
associate with human beings.</p>

to me, your most kind and loving wife, the sum of 2600l. quarterly to be

I would have two gentlewomen, lest one should be sick, or have some

to stand mumping alone, when God hath blessed their lord and lady with a
great estate. Also, when I ride a-hunting, or a hawking, or travel from
one house to another, I&nbsp;will have them attending; so, for either of
those said women, I&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">MUST AND WILL

myself, with four very fair horses; and a coach for my women, lined with
cloth, and laced with gold; the other with scarlet, and laced with
silver, with four good horses. Also I will have two coachmen, one for my
own coach, the other for my women. Also at any time when I travel,
I&nbsp;will be allowed not only <i>carroches</i>, and spare horses for
me and my women, but I will have such carriages as shall be fitting for
all, orderly, not pestering my things with my women’s; nor their’s with

<span class = "pagenum">385b</span>
when I travel, I&nbsp;will have them sent away before with the
carriages, to see all safe. And the chambermaids I will have go before,
that the chamber may be ready, sweet, and clean. Also for that it is
undecent to crowd up myself with my gentleman usher in my coach,
I&nbsp;will have him to have a convenient horse to attend me, either in
city or country. And I must have two footmen. And my desire is, that you
defray all the charges for me. And for myself, besides my yearly
allowance, I&nbsp;would have twenty gowns of apparel, six of them
excellent good ones, eight of them for the country, and six other of
them very excellent good ones. Also I would have to put in my purse
2000l. and 200l. and so you to <span class = "smallroman">PAY MY

their wages. Also, I&nbsp;will have all my houses furnished, and my

beds, stools, chairs, suitable cushions, carpets, silver warming-pans,
cupboards of plate, fair hangings, and such like. So for my drawing
chamber in all houses, I&nbsp;will have them delicately furnished, both
with hangings, couch, canopy, glass, carpet, chairs, cushions, and all
things thereunto belonging. Also my desire is, that you would <span

purchase lands, and lend no money, as you love God, to the
Lord-Chamberlain, who would have all, perhaps your life, from you.
Remember his son, my lord Walden, what entertainment he gave me, when
you were at Tilt-yard. If you were dead, he said, he would be a husband,
a&nbsp;father, a&nbsp;brother, and said he would marry me.
I&nbsp;protest, I&nbsp;grieve to see the poor man have so little wit and
honesty to use his friends so vilely. Also he fed me with untruths
concerning the Charter-house, but that is the least; he wished me much
harm, you know how. God keep you and me from him, and any such as he is.

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">There</span> are few
subjects which deserve a closer investigation of <ins class =
"correction" title = "text unchanged">the legislation of the legislative
power</ins>, and which is more neglected, than the excessive cruelty
that is exercised in this metropolis over unhappy, and devoted
<i>animals</i>. As they have no law to protect them, they are doubly
entitled to the attention of Humanity. It is scarcely possible to walk
through the city (London) without having one’s feelings tortured by the
abandoned race of butcher’s boys, and drovers. I&nbsp;could mention
many, I&nbsp;might say daily instances of what I have been painfully
compelled to witness, whenever I was led into that part of the town. One
only I will mention, which strongly evinces philanthropy on one hand,
and infamy on the other.</p>

<p>These contrasted practices belonging to the same class of people, the
lowest order, of the vulgar, are convincing proofs, that
<i>Education</i> has less to do with the formation of our ideas, and the
realization of our actions, than <i>Nature</i>. She governs the human
system, while she forms it; and however villainy may be glossed over by
the specious arts of accomplished deception in splendid life, or worth
may lie concealed under the thick shade of retirement, the innate
sentiment still “grows with our growth,” and effectually steers us
throughout the course of our existence.</p>

<p>It is not three weeks since I was going up Snow-hill, and was met by
a number of sheep, followed by one of these imps of the Devil that I
have mentioned. As I was standing by, to let them pass, I&nbsp;was
struck by the voice of an old woman, whose “tattered garment spoke
variety of wretchedness,” and who, (to continue the simile) was exactly
what Fancy pictures <i>Otway</i>’s witch to have been. She was mourning
over one of these wretched animals, who had sunk on its knees, exhausted
by ill-usage and fatigue. One horn was plucked out by the roots; its
legs were lacerated, and streaming with blood, which issued from the
nostrils, while the <i>man</i> (why I am <i>forced</i> to call
him&nbsp;so) was employing all his strength in belabouring, with a thick
stick, its agonized sides!&mdash;The old woman was remonstrating, with
all the eloquence of genuine humanity. It was a foreign language to a
wretch of this description, and he answered her in his own; while I
walked on; unable to bear the sight before me, or to attend to the
impious execrations of the infernal cause of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>How continually do we behold the newly-expired carcase of the
generous Horse, that has at last surrendered to toils beyond his
strength! The horse, which has been proudly contended for, and brought a
little mine of wealth
<span class = "pagenum">386b</span>
to his ungrateful master, is now denied by him even that little that
would make his old age comfortable. Houseless, and hungry, he smarts
under the galling whip, and is not allowed <i>that</i> rest which God
has equally ordained for man and brute. Mr. Dibdin’s justly celebrated
song of <i>The Race-Horse</i>, is more descriptive than I can be of the
horrid barbarities practised against this most useful creature; and
which is, both in strength and generosity, superior to his masters.</p>

<p>There are many licensed abuses; and I will confine myself to one more
only. It is an essential one, and ought to be remedied. I&nbsp;mean,
respecting <i>Servants</i>. This class of people is particularly happy
in its privileges. The Soldier, and the Sailor, are sure to meet with
severe corporal punishment, if, in the slightest instance, they disobey
the commands of their superior; but for the Servant, there is no
punishment, unless caught in the very act of robbery; and even then,
much money, time, and uneasiness, must be the cost, before you can bring
yourself publicly to expose them.</p>

<p>How continually it happens, that exorbitant wages are due to these
people, which it is not immediately convenient for the master, or
mistress, to discharge. In that case, the servant, well acquainted with
the circumstance, becomes insolent, or, at best, regardless; and if you
find fault with them, they ask you, why you do not pay, and discharge
them? while they are well convinced, that if you did pay and discharge
them, they must either adopt another mode of conduct, or be reduced to
beggary. But though these are facts too common throughout life, yet
still, for the honour of humanity, some exceptions are to be found, but,
in general, this inference may be drawn from contrasting characters of
the same description in different, though similar situations, and proves
one important fact, that in all situations, where vulgar minds can have
an ascendancy, or pre-eminence, tyranny will ever be the result of their
conduct, whether in the Drover or the Domestic.</p>

<p>The Courtezan, who, from dirt and darkness, emerges, by fortuitous
circumstances, to gaudy splendor, and untasted affluence; or the
low-bred mechanic, who, by carping care, and assiduous industry, in
taking the advantage of the wants of those with whom he has
acquaintance, or connection, rises into opulence, the vulgar mind will
always appear in their conduct and behaviour. A&nbsp;haughty overbearing
demeanor will always mark their manner to those who may have the
misfortune to be under their power, and inconsistent meanness will ever
appear, from under their most sumptuous trappings, when attempting
elegance and refinement&mdash;but why it should be so is neither
unnatural or wonderful&mdash;for the truth is, that conscious of their
own innate meanness, and incapacity to sustain the character they would
wish to assume, they conceive that all who have known them, or do know
them, entertain the same contemptible ideas of them as they do of
themselves, and hence conclude it necessary, in support of that dignity
to which they aspire, or assume, to treat those around them with hauteur
and tyranny, to impress on their minds a constant practice of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page387" id = "page387">387</a></span>
submission and obedience they wish to exact. It were well if the
indigent, who may attain to affluence, or the menial servant, who may
arise to superiority of situation in life, would recollect that
greatness of soul, and elevation of sentiment, are equally shown, though
not so efficaciously proved, in want as in wealth; in being commanded as
in commanding.</p>

<p>Ostensible situations to such as are incapable of filling them, only
display the imperfections of the possessor in a more prominent point of
view; and it were well also, if those whom Nature made in hasty moments,
and in its coarsest moulds, whom Reason never regenerated, nor Education
ever refined&mdash;whose ideas never have, and perhaps never can be
enlarged, and whose sentiments, if ever sentiments arose in the breast
of such persons, were only conducive to encourage them in the pursuit of
their grovelling designs, and barbarous and unrefined opinions, would
seek the coverture of the shade, rather than expose their fantastic
enormities, and preposterous ignorance and inability in the
sunshine.</p>


<h5 class = "extended"><i>FIFTH WANDERING.</i></h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">It</span> has been said, and more than that
it is generally believed, that happiness is not to be found on earth.
I&nbsp;deny it. For although I have never been allowed even to taste it
in domestic life (with which the world is too well acquainted to doubt
my veracity) yet I have observed almost daily instances of what I call
happiness; and which, if not admitted to be such by those in the
enjoyment of it, fully demonstrates a wilful incapacity to know its
value, and ingratitude to that Being who, for his own wise purposes,
bestows or takes it away.</p>

<p>There are two conditions of life from which only I conceive happiness
to be naturally excluded; and by these I mean the extremes of affluence
and penury. The man who abounds in wealth cannot be happy. His soul, if
naturally great, is confined within the narrow precincts of custom and
education, and has no room to expand itself. Few of these have courage,
if they do not want inclination, to pry into the distresses of their
fellow-creatures; and they dread the effect of prejudice, as they would
dread the effect of treason. I&nbsp;am sorry to speak from my own
observation, when I declare, that throughout this wealthy metropolis,
(London) I&nbsp;have never yet found one man, rich in the gifts of
fortune, who had spirit enough to disdain the tinsel shew that
surrounded him, and consecrate his time and his money to those whom he
seemed sent into the world to gladden and relieve. One only instance
have I heard of it in the female world; and to her virtues, more than to
her rank, may the honest tribute of applause, not the flattering voice
of adulation, be given: I&nbsp;mean the Dowager Countess <span class =
"locked">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>, where virtue unites itself to talents,
and both combine to render <i>her</i> on whom they are bestowed
inestimable. What heart can refrain from offering up thanks to its
Creator, who now and then condescends, as in <i>her</i>, to shew a
well-drawn picture of himself? While she lives, her numerous charities
cannot be forgotten; and when that God whom she adores transplants her
to a world more worthy of
<span class = "pagenum">387b</span>
her, still shall her name remain immortalized, while gratitude holds a
place in the hearts of the many indigent her bounties have deigned to
relieve!</p>

<p>But to proceed to my ideas of happiness;&mdash;I say ideas, because I
have only drawn a sketch of it from what I have seen, and from “<i>The
Wanderings of my Imagination</i>.” Can I picture to myself a greater
felicity than a happy independent family I once saw in Yorkshire? They
were many in number, yet one soul seemed to animate all. The old farmer,
who had no more than he wished for, nor wished for more than he
possessed, was one of those jovial, honest, well-meaning men, whose
knowledge of the world extended not beyond the limits of his own farm.
His family consisted of an old widowed sister, whom he supported, his
wife, three daughters, and a son, who imitating his sire in industrious
labour and attention to the peaceful and useful arts of agriculture, was
requited by that tranquillity of mind which is ever the result of a good
disposition.</p>

<p>Nature had by no means slighted the daughters in the formation of
their outward graces; but had, on the contrary, given convincing proofs
that those requisites necessary to engage the eye, and interest the
heart of every beholder, were to be met with in the unassuming manners,
and unaffected benignity, which beamed in each of their countenances.
These strongly indicated that their minds was the soil where all the
social virtues, that diffuse happiness alike to the possessor and those
in connection with them, were to be found cultivated and sublimed;
endowments which require more of the sunshine in life to sustain or
invigorate; but blossoming and ripening in the shade, bid defiance to
the canker of time, and the chilling damps of progressive age. Their
prospects in life bounded and unenlarged, gave increase of pleasure and
tranquillity, by their having fewer wants to suffice, and fewer
expectations to pursue; for the less desire we have for the
gratification of our passions, the more our minds must be at ease. The
airy phantoms and deluding visions raised by the magic of Imagination,
are more or less conjured up by awakened passions roused by variety of
scenes striking our different senses; those once awakened, are soon
allured; and allurements once indulged, are seldom allayed. But why do I
thus insensibly wander? Why am I deviating so widely and wildly from my
intended narration of rustic felicity? Yes, I&nbsp;must indulge it.
Visions of earthly pleasure, whither are you fled? Oh, social delights,
known only in domestic seclusion, and blooming only in sequestered
retirement, why am I forbid to enter your hallowed abodes? I&nbsp;must
now only in sadness survey what once I might have enjoyed, had the
dictates of nature (in me) been obeyed; and instead of being made the
victim of fashion, I&nbsp;should now be solacing myself with the
inestimable pleasures of a tranquil mind, and the rational reflection of
enjoying all that is worth enjoyment in life, and consequently
fulfilling all the ends for which life was bestowed. But, ah! like
thousands more who have lived, and will live hereafter, and in spite of
all that Poets have sung, and Philosophers taught, we live not for
ourselves, but for others.</p>

Scotland, when a benighted traveller knocks at a cottage door, and is
denied admittance by a female voice, he never dreams of grumbling at the
refusal, if the Caledonian dame subjoin, in her country’s phrase, that
she is a <i>lone</i> woman. Should some carping critic look through my
lattice, and censure me for sameness of sentiment, or barrenness of
fancy, I&nbsp;would reply, in an accent of deprecation&mdash;Mr. Zoilus,
I&nbsp;am a <i>lone author</i>. In the periodical publications of Great
Britain, the papers are usually furnished by the members of a literary
society, who assemble at some coffee-house or tavern, and club their
genius to amuse the public, as they club their cash to discharge their
reckoning. Those speculations, which have improved, and have gladdened
life, were rarely the fruit of a single brain, but the offspring of wit
in conjunction. The union of abilities is almost as essential to the
perfection of a miscellany, as the union of sexes to the formation of
our being. Both Genius and Dullness are prone to court
alliances.&mdash;Beaumont and Fletcher, composed comedies in company;
and Sternhold, when he undertook a translation of David’s psalms,
employed Hopkins to <i>eke</i> out his metre. Relying on his native
strength, Dr. Johnson composed a series of lucubrations himself; but who
is endowed with the comprehensive mind of the author of the Rambler?
Like a poor man loaded with a <i>fardel</i> of debt, common writers are
glad to borrow. Cursed occasionally with a penury of thought, and most
willing to pay my <i>public debt</i>, I solicit a hint from one,
a&nbsp;sentiment from another, and a subject from a third. Conscious of
imbecility, I&nbsp;dread stumbling in my <i>solitary</i> walk, and
timidity warns me to lean, sometimes on the staff of quotation, and
sometimes, to employ a guide. My acquaintance, Adage, who loves
sentences short and pithy, like himself, and who has read with
diligence, and who admires with judgment, the <span class =
"smallroman">PROMPTER</span>, requests me to compose an essay in his
laconic style. No, I&nbsp;replied, he has exhausted <i>Franklinisms</i>,
he has commented upon almost every common saying in the popular mouth.
Your reasons, Adage rejoined, are like Gratiano’s in the Merchant of
Venice; they are two grains of wheat, hid in two bushels of chaff, you
shall search all day ere you find them, and when found, they are not
worth the search. Be it my task to furnish a <i>subject</i>, to take the
pen and write quickly be thine. My neighbour Crispin, quoth Adage,
contracted last week with a countryman for cheese. It was damaged;
Crispin gives five pence per lb. and promises to pay in leather.
I&nbsp;thought he was over-reached; but, when the cheese-monger had
departed, Crispin laughingly cries, “if his cheese is mouldy, my leather
is unmerchantable, and <i>two cheats make an even bargain</i>.” As the
<span class = "smallroman">PROMPTER</span>, continued
<span class = "pagenum">388b</span>
Adage, never preached a sermon from that text, and as, to continue the
allusion, the bishop is slumbering in his stall, do you become his
chaplain, and ascend the pulpit yourself.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my friends advice, I quickly perceived that this
<i>even</i> bargain was concluded by many characters besides
<i>professional</i> cheats. An old London magazine, which I read many
years ago, and which memory just handed me, offers the first
example.</p>

<p>A brocaded Italian Count had an amour with Lady Ligonier. Every body
bewailed the fate of her unhappy husband; but every body did not know
that his wretchedness was alleviated in the arms of a courtezan. Every
body did not know, that these two right honourable cheats made an even
bargain.</p>

<p>A clown solicits an attorney to prosecute an obsolete claim against
neighbour Clodpole; the limb of the law knows that the claim of his
client is as lame, as <i>his</i> hobbling justice, he tells him
nevertheless that he will <i>recover</i>, and anticipates a heavy bill
of cost. He does his dirty work, and the plaintiff is nonsuited, who
emigrates to <i>Genesee</i>, and forgets to pay the advocate his fees.
Don’t fret, Mr. Greenbag, keep yourself cool, you have another cause to
argue, another false title to set up which will demand the calmness and

<p>A spruce stripling of sixteen, courts an old beldame of sixty. He
thinks her rich, and hopes that her gold will enable him to buy at the
female flesh market of beauty a more <i>juicy rib</i>. She, relying on
the bridegroom’s vigour, dreams of the <i>comforts</i> of matrimony, and
forthwith pronounces&mdash;I obey, before the Parson. But alas! the
bride’s purse is <i>coinless</i>, and the fond bridegroom chooses to
<i>consummate</i> elsewhere. I&nbsp;advise the husband when in
consequence of his wife’s fortune, he keeps a coach, to choose for a
motto, two cheats make an even bargain.</p>

<h4>SINGULAR CUSTOMS OF THE HINDOOS.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Although</span> the Hindoos
are naturally the most inoffensive of all mortals, yet does their
humanity consist more in abstaining from injurious, than in the
performance of beneficent actions. There is a wonderful mildness in
their manners, and also in their laws, which are influenced by their
manners; by which the murder of an human creature, and of a cow, are the
only crimes that are punished by death. Yet with all this gentleness of
disposition, they are inferior to the boisterous Europeans, with all
their vices, in the virtues of compassion and generosity. They are
wanting in that tenderness which is the most amiable part of our nature.
They are less affected by the distresses and dangers, and even the
accidental deaths of one another, than any nation I know
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page389" id = "page389">389</a></span>
in the old or new world. Yet they love to excess: a&nbsp;proof, either
of the inconstancy of the human character; or that the amorous passion
is not derived from the noblest part of our nature.</p>

<p>This insensibility of the Hindoos to the distresses and dangers of
their fellow-creatures, appears to me a wonderful phenomenon. Perhaps
that despotism which has long been exercised under the Mogul tyranny, by
familiarising the mind to scenes of death, has blunted a sense of its
terrors. Perhaps those ideas of predestination and irresistible fate,
which prevail in Asia, and in all despotic governments, prepares the
mind for an acquiescence in all events. An English gentleman was
standing by a native of Hindostan when an enormous and fierce tiger
leaped from a thicket, and carried off a screaming boy, the son of one
of his neighbours. The Englishman expressed symptoms of the most extreme
horror, while the Hindoo remained unmoved. “What,” said the former, “are
you unaffected by so dreadful a scene?”&mdash;“The great God,” said the
other, “would have it so.”&mdash;Whatever may be the cause, it is
certain, that death is regarded with less horror in India than in any
other country in the world. The origin and the end of all things, say
the philosophers of India of the present time, is a vacuum. A&nbsp;state
of repose is the state of greatest perfection: and this is the state
after which a wise man aspires. It is better, say the Hindoos, to sit
than to walk, and to sleep than to wake; but death is the best of
all.</p>

<p>According to the Gentoo laws, criminals sentenced to death are not to
be strangled, suffocated, or poisoned, but to be cut off by the sword;
because, without an effusion of blood, malefactors are supposed to die
with all their sins about them; but the shedding of their blood, it is
thought, expiates their crimes. The unjust punishment of Nundcomar, who
was hanged on a gibbet against the laws of his country, and even by an
<i>ex post facto</i> English law, was aggravated by that circumstance of
horror, that he died without an effusion of blood.</p>

<p>The Hindoos are well acquainted with the nature of simples, and apply
them judiciously either in performing cures which require not
amputation, or in effecting death by quick or slow poisons. They have
been for ages in the practice of inoculating for the small-pox; on which
occasion, as well as on others, they have recourse to the favourable
mediation of charms, or spells.</p>

<p>Although the practice of Hindoo women burning themselves on the
funeral piles of their husbands, and embracing in the mean time their
dead bodies in their arms, be not so general now as it has formerly
been, yet does it still prevail among some of the wives of men of high
caste or condition: and although this effort of frantic love, courage,
and ambition, be deemed an aggrandizement of the family and relations of
both husband and wife, but especially of the wife’s, yet their friends
and relations constantly endeavour to dissuade the women who declare
their resolutions of burning, from carrying them into execution. Even
the Brahmins do not encourage this practice.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">389b</span>
<p>The causes which inspire Hindoo women with this desperate resolution,
are, I&nbsp;imagine, the following:</p>

<p>In the first place; as the wife has, from her earliest infancy, been
betrothed in marriage to her husband, and from that time has never been
permitted to see another man; as she is instructed to believe that he is
perfectly accomplished, and taught to respect and honour him; as, after
consummation, she is shut up from the company, conversation, and even
the sight of other men, with still greater care, if possible, than
before, being now debarred from seeing even the father or elder brother
of her husband, the bonds of her affection must needs be inconceivably
strong and indissoluble. To an European lady the zenana naturally
appears in the light of an horrible prison: but the daughters of Asia
never consider confinement to the zenana as any hardship. They consider
it as a condition of their existence, and they enjoy all the happiness
of which they have any conception; their whole desires being concentered
and fixed on their husband, their food, jewels, and female
attendants.</p>

<p>In the second place, if the wife survive her husband, she cannot
marry again, and is treated as an inferior person, and an outcast from
her family. Nay, she is obliged, in her mournful and hopeless widowhood,
to perform all the offices of a menial servant.</p>

<p>In the third place, she is flattered with the idea of having
immortalized her name, and aggrandized her children, and her own and
husbands families.</p>

<p>Lastly, she is rendered insensible to the pains and horrors of what
she is to suffer, by those intoxicating perfumes and mixtures which are
administered to her after she has declared her final and unalterable
resolution&mdash;I say her final resolution, because one or two
declarations, of an intention to die with her husband, is not
sufficient.</p>

<p>The strength of her resolution undergoes a probation. There is a
certain time prescribed by the Gentoo law, during which her family and
friends exert their utmost influence in order to dissuade her from
burning; and if she persist in her resolution to the end of that period,
it is not lawful to use any more persuasions with her, to abandon it. If
she should alter her purpose after that period, she would be punished
with the loss of all castes, and live in a state of the most complete
misery and contempt. Nay, if an European or Christian does but touch her
very garment with his finger, when she is going to the pile, an
immediate stop is put to the ceremony, she is forced to live an outcast
from her family, and from the Gentoo religion.</p>

<p>You will doubtless, my friend, have curiosity to know, in what
manner, after all their stimulatives to perseverance, the tender sex,
among a soft and effeminate people, sustains the near approach, of a
scene so full of awe and horror. Amidst her weeping relations and
friends, the voluntary victim to love and honor alone appears serene and
undaunted. A&nbsp;gentle smile is diffused over her countenance: she
walks upright, with an easy but firm step; talks to those around her of
the virtues of the deceased, and of the joy with which she will be
transported when her shade shall meet with his; and encourages her
sorrowful attendants to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page390" id = "page390">390</a></span>
bear with fortitude the sight of those momentary sufferings which she
herself is going to feel.&mdash;Having ascended the funeral pile, she
lays herself down by the body of her husband, which she fervently
embraces. A&nbsp;dose of narcotic mixtures is then administered for the
last time; and instantly the person, whose office it is, sets fire to
the pile.</p>

<p>Thus the most determined resolution of which we can form any
conception, is found in the weaker sex, and in the soft climes of Asia.
It is to the honour of that sex and those climes, that the greatest
courage they exhibit, is the effect, not of the furious impulses of rage
and revenge, but conscious dignity and love.</p>

<p>It might naturally be imagined by an European, that the several wives
of one man (for polygamy is general throughout all Asia) would regard
one another with mutual jealousy and aversion: and that they in reality
do, has been asserted by writers of high reputation. The fact however is
quite otherwise: they visit one another with great friendship and
cordiality; and if they are of the same caste, will occasionally eat
together.&mdash;The husband is restrained from eating with his wives,
either by a regard to custom; or, as I have been informed by some of the
Gentoos themselves, by a precept of their religion.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the extreme antiquity of most Indian nations,
I&nbsp;am told that in India beyond the Ganges, on the confines of
Aracan and Pegu, there is a people (if solitary savages roaming through
woods in quest of prey, deserve the name of people) that appear to be in
the very first stage of society. They are the only people in the known
world that go absolutely naked, without the smallest covering on any
part of their bodies. They live on fruit, which grows spontaneously, in
the uncultivated deserts they inhabit, in great abundance; and on the
flesh of animals, which they tear alive and devour. They sit on their
hams, with their legs and arms disposed in the manner of monkeys. At the
approach of men, they fly into their woods. They take care of their
offspring, and live in families, but seem to have no ideas of
subordination of rank or civil government. I&nbsp;have never had
occasion to see this race of mortals myself, but I have conversed with
several persons who have seen them; all of whom concur in the general
account of them, which I have now given you.</p>

<h4>CHARACTER OF THE SWEDES,</h4>

<p class = "center smaller extended">FROM THE LETTERS OF MRS.
WOLLSTONECRAFT.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> Swedes pique
themselves on their politeness; but far from being the polish of a
cultivated mind, it consists merely of tiresome forms and ceremonies. So
far indeed from entering immediately into your character, and making you
feel instantly at your ease, like the well-bred French, their over-acted
civility is a continual restraint on all your actions. The sort of
superiority which a fortune gives when there is no superiority of
education, excepting what consists in the observance of senseless forms,
has a contrary effect than was intended; so that I could not help
reckoning
<span class = "pagenum">390b</span>
the peasantry the politest people of Sweden, who only aiming at pleasing
you, never think of being admired for their behaviour.</p>

<p>Their tables, like their compliments, seem equally a caricature of
the French. The dishes are composed, as well as their’s, of a variety of
mixtures to destroy the native taste of the food, without being as
relishing. Spices and sugar are put into every thing, even into the
bread, and the only way that I can account for their partiality to
high-seasoned dishes, is the constant use of salted provisions.
Necessity obliges them to lay up a store of dried fish, and salted meat,
for the winter; and in the summer, fresh meat and fish taste insipid
after them. To which may be added, the constant use of spirits. Every
day, before dinner and supper, even whilst the dishes are cooling on the
table, men and women repair to a side-table, and, to obtain an appetite,
eat bread and butter, cheese, raw salmon, or anchovies, drinking a glass
of brandy. Salt fish or meat then immediately follows, to give a further
whet to the stomach. As the dinner advances, pardon me for taking up a
few minutes to describe what, alas! has detained me two or three hours
on the stretch observing; dish after dish is changed, in endless
rotation, and handed round with solemn pace to each guest: but should
you happen not to like the first dishes, which was often my case, it is
a gross breach of politeness to ask for part of any other till its turn
comes.</p>

<h4>METHOD IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF IDEAS.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> delivering our
sentiments on particular subjects, there is nothing which is attended
with better effect, and makes us appear to more advantage than offering
our opinions with clearness and precision; and this can only be done by
arranging them in proper order, so that they may appear regularly to
arise one from the other: this is stiled method, and prevents confusion;
hinders us from indulging in the luxuriance of fancy, running into
desultory digressions, and makes us appear superior to our subject.</p>

<p>Where great sprightliness is the natural bent of the temper, girls
should endeavour to habituate themselves to a custom of observing,
thinking, and reasoning. It is not necessary that they should devote
themselves to abstruse speculation, or the study of logic; but she who
is accustomed to give a due arrangement to her thoughts, to reason
justly and pertinently on common affairs, and judiciously to deduce
effects from their causes, will be a better logician than some of those
who claim the name, because they have studied the art. That species of
knowledge, which appears to be the result of reflection rather than of
science, fits peculiarly well on women.</p>


<p class = "twin w12">&nbsp;</p>

<h4>BEHAVIOUR.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">One</span> of the chief
beauties in a female character is that modest reserve, that retiring
delicacy which avoids the public eye, and is disconcerted even at the
gaze of admiration. For when a girl ceases to blush, she has lost the
most powerful charm of beauty. That extreme sensibility, which it
indicates, is peculiarly engaging.</p>

<p>Silence in company, particularly a large one, is never mistaken by
the judicious and discerning for dullness, but bespeaks a modesty
essential in the female sex. Dignity of behaviour is necessary at public
places, but care must be taken not to mistake that for that confident
ease, that unabashed countenance which seems to set the company at
defiance.</p>

<p>Women should be cautious even in displaying their good sense. It is
often thought assuming a superiority over the rest of the company; but
their learning should be kept a profound secret, especially from men,
who generally look
<span class = "pagenum">393b</span>
with a jealous and malign eye on a woman of great parts, and a
cultivated understanding.</p>

<p>The great art of pleasing in conversation consists in making the
company pleased with themselves. Detraction should be avoided,
especially amongst women where their own sex is concerned; it would be
more noble for them to shew a compassionate sympathy to the unfortunate,
especially to those who are rendered so by the villainy of men. It is a
laudable pride, as well as secret pleasure, which ought to be indulged,
in being the friend and refuge of the unhappy, but without the vanity of
shewing&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Every species of indelicacy in conversation should be considered as
shameful and highly disgusting. A&nbsp;sacred regard should ever be had
to truth, for lying is a mean and despicable vice; though a lively
embellishment of a humorous story, which is only intended to promote
innocent mirth, cannot be understood to fall under that head.</p>

<p>Gentleness of spirit and manners is extremely engaging; but not that
indiscriminate attention, that unmeaning simper, which smiles on all
alike. For this arises either from affectation of softness, or from
perfect insipidity.</p>

<p>A fine woman, like other fine things in nature, has her proper point
of view, from which she may be seen to most advantage. To fix this point
requires great judgment, and an intimate knowledge of the human heart.
By the present mode of female manners, the ladies seem to expect that
they shall regain their ascendency over men, by the fullest display of
their personal charms, by being always in their eyes at public places,
by conversing with them with the same unreserved freedom as they do with
one another; in short, by resembling men as near as they can. The folly
of this expectation and conduct will soon be shown. For the power of a
fine woman over the hearts of men, of men of the finest parts, is even
beyond what she conceives. They are sensible of the pleasing illusion,
but they cannot, nor do they wish, to dissolve it. But if she is
determined to dispel the charm, it certainly is in her power, she may
soon reduce <i>the angel <ins class = "correction"
title = "italicized as shown: error for plain type?">to</ins> a very ordinary girl</i>.</p>

<p>In fine, to form a complete lady, she should possess the most perfect
simplicity of heart and manners; dignity without pride, affability
without meanness, and simple elegance without affectation.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> pleasures of a
fashionable life may not be unaptly compared to the delirium of the
brain in a high fever. ’Tis in vain we in imagination visit ærial scenes
fraught with all that fancy can bestow to give delight: ’tis in vain we
visit gorgeous palaces, and partake of sumptuous banquets, while seated
in the magic circle of Wit and Beauty, we enjoy the radiant smiles of
the happy, and the compliments of the facetious and the learned: we even
in the height of our frenzy still feel there is a chasm in our
pleasures, and a vacuum in our pursuits and enjoyments; and when awake
to reflection, we most sensibly feel that all has been
deception&mdash;the malady still rages, and the fever still remains.</p>

<p>But I revert to my first idea, and maintain that happiness is to be
found; and that I witnessed it in the family I have mentioned: they were
uniformly and completely happy in each other; and the casualties of fate
appeared not to terrify by their approach an individual belonging to it.
Had that happiness they amply possest been sufficient to satisfy them,
without searching farther into the world for an addition to it, one of
its branches had not, by creating her own misery, cast a bleak veil over
her fate, and impeded that heart-felt satisfaction which from her alone
knew interruption.</p>

<p>Nancy, the youngest daughter, was by nature more susceptible than the
rest. She had seen a young sailor in the neighbourhood, and against the
advice of all her true friends, contented to marry him, when he should
return from a foreign embarkation. She bore his departure with seeming
composure; but a few letters she received from him baffled all that
parental love could endeavour to save her, and on the first report of
the fleet’s intended return, she packed up a few necessaries, took the
little money she was, through the indulgence of her parents, become
mistress of, and unknown to all, set forward on her disconsolate journey
to Portsmouth, to wait his return.</p>

<p>For some weeks she waited in vain; at length the ship to which he
belonged arrived in the harbour. She eagerly discovered the means by
which she could go on board; and fancy pictured to her ravished senses
his delight on thus proving her unabated love. Alas, poor Nancy! the
ship indeed returned, but her William had been long consigned to a
watery grave. In silent grief she bore the dismal tidings, and returned
to her desolate abode. For three days she pined in speechless agony, and
on the fourth her account was made.</p>

<h5 class = "extended"><i>SIXTH WANDERING.</i></h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">It</span> was in one of those fine autumnal
evenings, when the Sun, while sinking beneath the last cloud of
departing day, tinged the blue mountains with a paly light, that chance
directed my footsteps from <i>Chepstow</i>, to the all-charming and
romantic retirement of <i>Piercefield</i>. The deputed guardian of its
woods indulged my request, and left me to myself.</p>

<p>As I wandered alone and pensive over the beauteous scene, no noise
but the soft moaning of the leaves, gently agitated by the summer
breeze, or the distant voice of the nightingale, interrupted my
meditations, while I silently and sadly lamented the fate of its late
unfortunate, and hospitable possessor. Was it from hence
(thought&nbsp;I) that our first parents were precipitated into the abyss
of woe, and will <i>Man</i> be never resigned to his lot? Will he prefer
to that path which Nature pointed out for him to follow, the tongue of
envy<span class = "locked">---</span>the voice of detraction<span class

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page395" id = "page395">395</a></span>
to a vision, the pure, true unadulterated joys of rural and domestic
felicity? Vain and transitory are all sublunary desires; and the objects
of whatever kind our fantastic imagination greedily pursues, soon cloy
in the possession. There is no substantial delight but that which we
derive from conscious rectitude; and the vicissitudes of the world, like
the turbulence of the ocean, if they do not plunge the incautious into
actual perdition, will, by annihilating their senses, leave in them a
blank, that no future period will fill&nbsp;up.</p>

<p>The gloom that was beginning to dim the horizon, insensibly enveloped
my ideas, and the solitude of the woods heightened it. It was the hour
when the sky-lark chaunted its evening hymn to its Creator, as it soared
beyond the confines of sight. The lofty pines waved their high heads to
the wind, and now and then a few straggling leaves, that had loitered
beyond their time, rustled through the thick branches, while gently
falling towards the ground.</p>

<p>On a sudden, the voice of distant music caught my ear. I listened,
and distinguished the sweet sounds of the plaintive harp. My heart
responsively echoed the mournful melody, and I approached the spot from
whence it issued. The Harper, whom I recollected to have seen before,
was blind, and infirm, and his name was Llewyllin. He was sitting at the
foot of a tree, and his dog, who sat watchfully by him, retained his
station, seeming sensible of the attractions his master possessed,
instead of being impressed with fear, or alarm, at the approach of a
stranger.</p>

<p>A very lovely girl, more interesting than beautiful, stood leaning
against the tree in a pensive attitude; she observed me, and, as if
recovering from the reverie I had interrupted, with a soft, but dejected
smile, requested her father (for such I found him to&nbsp;be) would
repeat the variations of Pleyell’s German Hymn. The slow, and solemn
measure, raised my soul to Heaven, while my uplifted eyes invoked the
pardon of human frailties, and the rapturous enthusiasm invigorated my
mind.</p>

<p>The Harper arose, his dog trotted on before, and I accepted the
proffered arm of the lovely Julia. Our conversation was on trifling
subjects, and the increasing darkness added an awful solemnity to the
stillness of the scene, as the bat flitted round us, and the solitary
owl poured forth her wailing plaints to the full-rising Orb of Night.
From the high eminence we espied the beautiful little town of
<i>Chepstow</i>; its various lamps reflected on the smooth surface of
the <i>Severn</i>, while the distant dashing of oars proclaimed our
re-union with the world, from which the peaceful groves of
<i>Piercefield</i> had just before seemed to separate&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>Julia and I, whose tastes already appeared to be formed for each
other, delighted ourselves with the majestic scenery above and below us.
We retraced to our memories <i>The Sorrows of Werter</i>, while we gazed
on his favourite constellation, and compared its superiority over the
luminous bodies that surrounded it. But alas! these chearing prospects
gladdened not the heart of our companion; his day was set in everlasting
night, and I sighed while I surveyed the marks of placed resignation
that beamed on his benign countenance.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">395b</span>
<p>I accepted Julia’s invitation, and accompanied her home. She
inhabited, with her father, a&nbsp;small neat cottage, which she had
adorned with the elegant ornaments of rustic simplicity: she touched the
harp with less skill than did her father, but the gracefulness of her
attitude while seated at it, was all her own. She had a winning
sweetness of manners, and a captivating gentleness of disposition, which
alike charmed and secured the hearts of those who beheld her. With pious
diligence she discharged the duties of filial care; and as she watched
over him with affectionate zeal, she prevented the desires of her
father.</p>

<p>We parted at an early hour, more refreshed than fatigued by the
excessive long walk we had taken; our minds had expanded in the
interview, and it was the beginning of an acquaintance that seemed to
promise an exquisite source of mental enjoyment, both to Julia and
myself.</p>

<p>Till the present moment, the intercourse of female friendship had
been unknown to Julia. The inhabitants of Chepstow, where they had lived
five years, were either too lofty, or too low, to afford gratification
to a susceptible mind. Yet, although her knowledge of the world extended
no farther than what she could collect from the books of a small
circulating library, with which she beguiled the heavy hours of her
father, she had acquired from these, and the polished understanding with
which Nature had endowed her, those requisites which alone were
necessary to render her a most desirable and interesting companion.</p>

<p>We met every day, and our friendship was established in less time
than custom allows to a common acquaintance. Julia, whose notions were
above the prejudices of the vulgar, would artlessly reveal to me her
ideas as they arose, but left me to conjecture on the subject of her
heart, which, from her frequent sighs, and some very distant hints,
I&nbsp;could perceive had not been hitherto insensible.</p>

<p>We went frequently to Piercefield, where, after placing Mr. Llewyllin
on a convenient seat, we would wander from him just far enough to hear
the distant sounds of the harp, which, as they died away, marked the
length of our progression.</p>

<p>Julia, in one of those walks, took occasion to enquire of me, if I
had ever seen <i>Swansea?</i> I answered her in the negative, and she
added with a sigh, that her father would describe it to me better than
she could. The evening dews were beginning to fall, and we joined him in
our walk towards home.</p>

<p>We were no sooner arrived there, than I repeated to him Julia’s
question, which he answered, by giving me his narrative.</p>

of courtesans, assuming the manners and language of ladies of quality.
The penetrating humourist, at the close of every sentence from these
frail damsels, boasting intimacy with high life, emphatically and
poignantly exclaims, “Fudge.” When the ridiculous in manners, or the
insipid in conversation and life, appears to <i>Tom Toledo</i>, whose

respect from the family; or whether certain envious prudes, as is their
wont, have leagued, and look prim against her, when she appears, is a
question I cannot <i>sagely</i> solve. Certain it is, she is degraded

<h4>INTERESTING STORY OF MADELAINE.</h4>

<p class = "center smaller extended">BY HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS.</p>

<p class = "first">A <span class = "smallcaps">Friend</span> of mine,
who is lately gone to Toulouse, has sent me from thence an account of
some circumstances which happened not long ago in that part of France,
and which she says are still much the subject of conversation.
I&nbsp;shall transcribe this narrative, which I believe will interest
you. Perhaps a novel-writer, by the aid of a little additional misery,
and by giving the circumstances which actually happened a heightened
colour&mdash;by taking his pallet, and dashing with a full glow of red
what nature had only tinged with pale violet, might almost spin a volume
from these materials. Yet, after all, nothing is so affecting as
simplicity, and nothing so forcible as truth. I&nbsp;shall therefore
send you the story exactly as I received it; and in such parts of it as
want interest, I&nbsp;beg you will recollect that you are not reading a
tale of fiction; and that in real life incidents are not always placed
as they are in novels, so as to produce
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page397" id = "page397">397</a></span>
stage effect. In some parts of the narrative you will meet with a little
romance; but, perhaps, you will wonder that you meet with no more; since
the scene is not in the cold philosophic climate of England, but in the
warm regions of the south of France, where the imagination is elevated,
where the passions acquire extraordinary energy, and where the fire of
poetry flashed from the harps of the Troubadours amidst the sullen gloom
of the Gothic ages.</p>

<p>A young Frenchman, whose usual residence was at Paris, having
travelled as far as Toulouse the year before the Revolution, was invited
by a party of his friends to accompany them to Bareges, where some of
them were going in pursuit of amusement and others in search of health
from the medicinal springs which rise so plentifully, both in hot and
cold streams, among the Pyrenean mountains.</p>

<p>This young Parisian, who had some taste for the sublime scenery of
Nature, felt that it would be luxury to leave a little longer the
regular walks, which Art had planted in the Tuilleries, and the trim
gardens and jets d’eaux she has formed at Versailles; to wander amongst
those piles of mountains which overhang each other, and listen to the
torrents which fall down them with loud and irresistible
impetuosity.</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“Rich in her weeping country’s spoils, Versailles</p>
<p>May boast a thousand fountains, that can cast</p>
<p>The tortur’d waters to the distant heav’ns;</p>
<p>Yet let me choose some pine-topp’d precipice</p>
<p>Abrupt and shaggy, whence a foamy stream,</p>
<p>Like Anio, tumbling roars.”&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>What powerful sensations does the first view of such a scene
produce!&mdash;We seem to begin a new existence&mdash;every former
impression is for a while erased from the memory, and the mind feels
<ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for enrapt?">enrapped</ins> and lost in the strong emotions of awe,
astonishment, and admiration.</p>

<p>Bareges was crouded, as it usually is in the season, not only with
French company, but also with strangers, who travel from other
countries, in order to use its celebrated baths. The company amused
themselves, as they generally do at water-drinking places, by
sauntering, lounging, cards, lotteries, jeux-d’ésprit, and scandal.</p>

<p>Bareges is a very expensive place. Even moderate accommodations must
be purchased at a high rate; and provisions, as well as lodgings, are
sometimes obtained with difficulty. Bareges is therefore seldom resorted
to by any but people of considerable fortune, who can afford to level
the obstacles which mountains interpose to their conveniences and
comforts, by the all subduing force of gold.</p>

<p>Among a number of persons of rank and fortune, there was however one
family at Bareges in a different situation. This family consisted of an
elderly infirm French officer, who had long been afflicted with the
palsy, and his daughter, a&nbsp;young woman about nineteen years of age.
Their appearance and mode of living seemed to indicate, that, though in
search of relief, this old officer had journeyed to Bareges, he had in
so doing far exceeded the bounds of economy, which his circumstances
prescribed, and was forced to deny himself every accommodation his
infirmities could spare. He
<span class = "pagenum">397b</span>
lived in the most retired manner, in the worst lodgings at Bareges; and,
while the other ladies were dressed in a style of expensive variety and
profusion, his daughter wore only a plain linen gown, which, though
always perfectly clean, was coarse; and her dark hair was left
unpowdered and without any ornament whatever. Fortunately for Madelaine,
however, (for that was her name) her person was calculated to make her
coarse gown appear to the best advantage; and though she was not very
beautiful, her countenance had an expression of sweetness which answered
the end of beauty by exciting love and admiration.</p>

<p>The company at Bareges soon became acquainted with each other, and
the ladies always took notice of Madelaine when they met her in their
walks, which however did not happen very often, for her father was
frequently unable so go out. When he did, he was supported on one side
by Madelaine, and on the other by his servant. It was impossible to see
with insensibility the attention which this interesting young woman paid
to her father, whom she never quitted one moment. It was remarked with
what careful tenderness she used to lead him along the streets of
Bareges, walking the slowest pace she could, and watching his steps as
he moved feebly on. And when he was not able to venture out, she was
seen at the window of their little parlour reading in order to entertain
him. Her looks and manner announced that her disposition was naturally
sprightly, and that she would have been gay if her father had not been
sick. But all the chearfulness she could assume while he suffered, was
exerted to amuse him, and shorten the tedious hours of langour and
debility.</p>

<p>Though Madelaine was handsome, the obscurity and seclusion in which
she lived preserved her from the envy of the women. They <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘new’">knew</ins> well enough that the
gentlemen at Bareges were for the most part men of the world, who,
though they may admire beauty, and <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘appove’">approve</ins> of virtue, are never so far the dupes
of any tender or moral sentiment as to let it interfere either with
their vanity, their ambition, or their interest. Although the French
Revolution had not yet happened, these ladies were aware that, with
respect to marriage, the age of <i>calculators</i> was already come, and
therefore no rival was to be feared in Madelaine. The ladies joined with
the men in admiring the graces of her person, and the amiable qualities
which her conduct displayed. Madelaine, in short, became the object of
general esteem.</p>

<p>Auguste, for so I shall call our young Parisian, who has lost his
title since the laws of equality have been established in his
country&mdash;Auguste spoke less of Madelaine than the other gentlemen
at Bareges; but it was perhaps because he thought of her more.
Sometimes, in his solitary morning rambles, he used to make comparisons
between her and the Parisian ladies among whom he had passed the winter,
and the comparison generally ended with a deep sigh. The scene of these
meditations was certainly much in Madelaine’s favour. Perhaps, at Paris
or Versailles, Auguste might have been dazzled by the polished graces of
a fine lady rouged, powdered, perfumed, and equipped for conquest. These
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page398" id = "page398">398</a></span>
artificial attractions might perhaps have accorded well enough with
clipped trees, and angular walks. But Madelaine’s simple manners,
Madeline’s natural smiles and unstudied blushes, were far more in unison
with the Pyrenean mountains.</p>

<p>One evening, when Auguste was walking in the town of Bareges with
some ladies, he saw Madelaine at a little distance assisting with great
difficulty to support her father, who appeared to be seized with a fit.
Auguste darted like an arrow towards the spot, and held up the officer
till he found himself somewhat recovered; and then Auguste, with a sort
of gentle violence, obliged Madelaine, who was pale and trembling, to
let go her father’s arm and suffer him to assist the servant in leading
him home, which was but a few steps farther. Auguste entered the house,
where he remained till the old officer was a little revived; and, after
prevailing upon Madelaine to take a few hartshorn drops, he retired.</p>

<p>The next morning he felt that common civility required he should pay
the old officer a visit, and learn how he had passed the night. It
happened that Madelaine had the very same idea. “Surely,” thought she,
“it will be very strange if this young man, who was so kind, so careful
of my father, and who made me take some hartshorn drops, should neglect
to call and enquire after us!” This idea had come across her mind
several times; and she was meditating upon it at her father’s bedside,
when Auguste was announced.</p>

<p>The old officer, who had all the finished politeness of his country
and his profession, received him in the most courteous manner; and,
though he spoke with some difficulty, yet he was profuse in
acknowledgments for the service Auguste had rendered him. Madelaine’s
thanks were few and simply expressed; but the tone in which they were
uttered was such that Auguste felt he could have sacrificed his life to
have deserved them.</p>

<p>The old officer still continued sick, and therefore Auguste still
considered it as an indispensable mark of attention to go every day, and
learn the state of his health. He also began to feel that these visits
became every day more necessary to his own happiness. That happiness
was, indeed, embittered by many painful reflections. He well knew, that
to obtain his father the Count de &mdash;&mdash;’s&nbsp;consent to marry
Madelaine, was as impossible as it was for himself to conquer the
passion she had inspired. He knew exactly the order in which his
father’s enquiries would run on this subject. He was aware that there
were two interrogatories to be answered. The first was&mdash;“How many
thousand livres has she a year?” And the second&mdash;“Is she noble?”
And nothing could be more embarrassing than that the enquiry concerning
fortune would, he was sure, come first: since that was the only article
which could not be answered in a satisfactory manner; for to Madelaine’s
family no objection could have been made. By the way, though the former
nobility of France would not absolutely contaminate the pure streams of
noble blood by an union with the daughter of a <i>roturier</i>, they had
always sufficient generosity to abate
<span class = "pagenum">398b</span>
some generations of nobility in favour of a proper equivalent in
wealth.</p>

<p>Auguste, while he was convinced of the impossibility of obtaining his
father’s consent to his marriage, did not pay Madelaine one visit the
less from that consideration; and when the usual hour of his visit
arrived, he often suddenly broke a chain of admirable reasoning on the
imprudence of his attachment, in order to hasten to the dwelling of her
he loved. In a short time he ceased all kind of reasoning on the
subject, and abandoned his heart without reserve to the most violent and
unconquerable passion.</p>

<p>Auguste made a declaration to the old officer of the sentiments which
his daughter had inspired. The old gentleman mentioned it to Madelaine;
and she only answered by tears, of which he perfectly understood the
meaning. When Auguste explained his situation with respect to his
father, the officer desired him to think of his daughter no more.
Auguste felt that he might as well have desired him to cease to breathe.
He continued his visits, and the officer was soon reduced to that state
of languor and debility which left him neither the power nor the wish to
forbid them. His complaints increased every day, and were attended with
many alarming symptoms. The season for the waters of Bareges was now
past, and all the company left the place, except the old officer, who
was too weak to be removed, and Auguste, who, while Madelaine remained,
had no power to tear himself from the spot. In a few weeks the old
officer felt that his dying hour was near. Auguste knelt with Madelaine
at his bedside&mdash;her voice was suffocated by tears; and Auguste had
scarcely power to articulate in broken accents that he would devote his
life to the happiness of Madelaine. The old officer fixed his eyes with
a look of tender anxiety upon his daughter, and soon after expired.
Madelaine mourned for her father with uncontrouled affliction; nor could
all the attentions of her lover dispel that anguish, with which her
affectionate heart lamented the loss of her parent.</p>

<p>The winter being far advanced, she proposed to defer her journey to
the distant province where she and her father had lived, until spring,
and to place herself in the mean time in a convent not far from Bareges.
Auguste exerted all the eloquence of love, to induce her to consent
immediately to a private marriage. She hesitated at this proposal; and,
while they were conversing together on the subject, the door of the room
in which they were sitting was suddenly thrown open, and Auguste saw his
father the Count de &mdash;&mdash; enter. He had heard of the attachment
which detained his son at Bareges, and had hastened to tear him from the
spot before it was too late. He upbraided his son with great bitterness,
and began also to upbraid Madelaine: but there was something in her
looks, her silence, and her tears, which stifled the terms of haughty
reproach in which he was prepared to address her; and, ordering his son
to leave the room, he desired to speak to her alone. After explaining to
her the absolute impossibility of her being ever united to his son, and
his determination to disinherit him, and leave his whole fortune to his
second son, if Auguste should persist
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page399" id = "page399">399</a></span>
in his attachment to her&mdash;after endeavouring to awaken her pride
and her generosity, he desired to know where she proposed going. She
told him her intention of placing herself immediately in the convent of
&mdash;&mdash;. He approved of this design, and left her to go to his
son. No sooner was the door of the room shut, than Madelaine gave way to
those tears which she had scarcely been able to restrain while the Count
was speaking. She had never felt so sensibly her orphan condition as at
this moment; and the dear remembrance of her fond father, was mingled
with the agony of disappointed love.</p>

<p>Mean time the Count de &mdash;&mdash; declared to his son, that his
only chance of ever obtaining his mistress depended on his absolute
unconditional submission to his commands, and that he must instantly
attend him to Paris. Auguste eagerly enquired what was to become of
Madelaine; and his father told him that she had determined to take
refuge in the convent of &mdash;&mdash;. Auguste absolutely refused to
depart till he was allowed an interview with Madelaine. The Count was
obliged to consent; but before he suffered them to meet, he obtained a
promise from Madelaine not to mention to her lover any particulars of
the conversation which had passed between her and the Count.</p>

<p>Auguste, in this last interview with Madelaine, atoned for the cruel
disdain of his father, by the most solemn and passionate assurances of
fidelity, not to be shaken by time or circumstance; and then, after
attempting to leave the room several times, and returning as often, he
at length tore himself away. Madelaine, when she saw him depart, felt
that every earthly hope had vanished with him.</p>

<p>She set out early the next morning for the convent of &mdash;&mdash;;
but not till after she had sat some time weeping in the chair which
Auguste used to occupy.</p>

<p>Accordingly, being introduced into the Royal presence, and every

Mayor, who appeared aukward and embarrassed, gently jogged his elbow,
and at the same time whispered in his ear, “Hold up your head&mdash;look
like a man.” The Mayor mistaking this for the beginning of the speech,
stared the King boldly in the face, and with a loud

fearing his Majesty’s displeasure, still whispering in the Mayor’s ear
said, “By <span class = "locked">G&mdash;d</span>, Sir, you’ll ruin us

still staring the King in the face, with a louder voice than before
repeated, “By <span class = "locked">G&mdash;d</span>, Sir, you’ll ruin

</div>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Retired</span> from the
busy scenes of the world, in a village near H&mdash;&mdash;, lives
Lucretia, with her daughters, Emma and Maria. Emma is in her eighteenth
year; her person is elegant, and her mind enriched with every
accomplishment that can adorn or endear the female character: Maria, who
has only completed fourteen, to a beautiful countenance, joins the more
fascinating charms of a well-improved understanding. Lucretia is an
affectionate mother, who uses every endeavour to inspire her daughters
with such sentiments of religion and virtue as will be conducive to
their present and future happiness. She has once moved in the higher
circles of life; but, though misfortunes have eclipsed her former
grandeur, they have brought that felicity which <i>fashionable Folly</i>
never knows. It gave me infinite pleasure to hear her address her
daughters&mdash;“My dear children” said she, “never reflect that your
family was once great in the esteem of the world; it will only create
ambitious thoughts, and destroy inward peace, which is an inestimable
blessing. I&nbsp;can assure you, that happiness is no attendant on the
great, nor could I ever find real pleasure in high life. Never did I
experience that simple, but substantial felicity, which is always easily
obtained, till Providence humbled my fortunes. May you ever submit to
its dispensations! Heaven is best able to judge what is proper for us.
It is one of my chief comforts, to believe that things are not governed
by chance; but are under the direction of an All-wise Being. Never
forget, that virtue is the greatest happiness, and innocence the highest
accomplishment!&mdash;To witness the sweet content that smiles on every
face, the noble disgust they manifest against the follies and amusements
of the <i>Little</i> Great, and the dissipated manners of the age, is
truly admirable!” A&nbsp;tender esteem unites the two sisters; and
Lucretia, who is a sensible and accomplished woman, contributes all in
her power to increase harmony and love. The frivolous conversation that
disgraces our <i>well bred</i> companies, never engages them. The tale
of virtuous distress excites the tear of sympathy; at the recital
<span class = "pagenum">401b</span>
of any magnanimous action, a&nbsp;kindred emulation fires the bosom;
but, at the deed of infamy, the abhorrence they feel is sufficiently
marked in each expressive countenance. If the happy fire-side is any
where enjoyed, surely it must be in such a family as this; where social
converse, enlivened by female sweetness, cheers the wintry night! Where
the art of disguising sentiments, and feigning what they never feel, is
utterly unknown; where fastidious compliments never approach; and none
are entertained at the expence of another’s feelings.&mdash;Ye, who
glitter in Fashion’s splendid sphere, enjoying all that luxurious Wealth
can give; whose days are one continued round of diversions, and for whom
invention is wearied to contrive new pleasures; say, do you ever
experience the happiness of such a family as I have thus faintly
endeavoured to describe?</p>

<h4><span class = "super">COMPASSION</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Compassion</span> is an
emotion of which we ought never to be ashamed. Graceful, particularly in
youth, is the tear of sympathy, and the heart that melts at the tale of
woe. We should not permit ease and indulgence to contract our
affections, and wrap us up in selfish enjoyment. But we should accustom
ourselves to think of the distresses of human life, of the solitary
cottage, the dying parent, and the weeping orphan. Nor ought we ever to
sport with pain and distress in any of our amusements; nor treat even
the meanest insect with wanton cruelty.</p>

<p>It has been objected, and it is to be feared with some reason, that
female conversation is too frequently tinctured with a censorious
spirit, and that ladies are seldom apt to discover much <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘terderness’">tenderness</ins> for the
errors of a fallen sister. No arguments can justify, no pleas
extenuate&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>To insult over the miseries of an unhappy creature is inhuman, not to
compassionate them is unchristian. The worthy part of the sex always
express themselves humanely on the failings of others, in proportion to
their own undeviating goodness, and by that gentle virtue are prompted
to alleviate the distresses of the unfortunate and wretched; it prevents
us from retaliating injuries; and restrains our severe judgments and
angry passions.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“In</span> the town of
Glamorgan, Madam, I drew my first breath of life; but my entrance into
the world was marked by the deprivation of its first blessing. As I
never beheld the day (of which I can only form a very imperfect idea),
I&nbsp;am the better reconciled to my unhappy destiny. One keen regret
alone embitters my existence; and although I must not repine at the
dispensations of Providence, nor arraign the justice of the Most High,
I&nbsp;feel to its full extent the misery of having never been blessed
with the sight of my daughter, whose piety has sustained my drooping
years, and almost taught me to forget that I have a wish
ungratified.”</p>

<p>At that moment a string of the harp which stood in its usual corner,
snapped aloud, and Julia taking it under her arm, withdrew with it into
her own apartment, seemingly rejoiced at a pretext to leave the room,
that she might conceal by retiring the visible emotion that began to
overspread her feeling countenance.</p>

<p>The old man requested her to put it in proper order, and continued
his story.</p>

<p>“As it was impossible for me to be brought up to any business in the
town where we lived, and as my love of music had from my earliest years
surpassed every other inclination, my father proposed sending me to
London in my nineteenth year, that I might try in the musical world
whether my abilities were sufficient to ensure me there a quiet and
comfortable independence. But before he could adopt any measure that he
thought likely to succeed, I&nbsp;had, without his knowledge, accepted
the offering of a heart born to pity and to love me. A&nbsp;niece of my
father’s resided under our roof; her unceasing assiduities and advances
which I could not fail to comprehend, drew from me a sentiment hitherto
unknown, and influenced every future action of my life. My cousin was
young, and, I&nbsp;have heard, handsome. ’Tis probable, that had my
situation been different, we might never have been united; but the
pleasure she took in describing the objects around me, and that tender
compassion she so evidently felt for my hapless infirmity, soon disposed
my heart to the warmest gratitude, and to that a more tender passion
soon succeeded. The result of this attachment soon made a visible
alteration on the person of my cousin; and our intercourse, which had
been long suspected, was at length discovered. An immediate marriage was
the consequence; but the day that gave life to my Julia, deprived her
mother of&nbsp;it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">402b</span>
<p>“About this time, while we were yet uncertain whether I should go,
and as my father’s house was a continual memento of my late sad loss,
Mr. David Evans visited our town, and as he excelled on the harp, took
pleasure to instruct me. I&nbsp;devoted my time to his lessons, and
their practice; but my studies would have been soon interrupted by his
departure, had not Sir Herbert Williams arrived with his family at an
estate he had lately purchased between Swansea and Glamorgan, and
insisted on Evans taking up his residence in his house.</p>

<p>“In the course of the ensuing summer many gentlemen who visited that
delightful spot, were pleased to bestow the highest encomiums on my
performances: they proposed my making the tour of England, and held
forth the most flattering promises of liberal patronage and support.
A&nbsp;subscription was, at the close of the season, raised by them; and
Evans who wished for (though he did not absolutely want) money, sold me
at a moderate price the harp now in my possession, having another which
he preferred to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“I quickly sallied forth as an adventurer, and for some time
succeeded beyond my expectations. I&nbsp;was admired, courted, and
caressed; but the novelty at length dissipated the charm, and I was no
sooner, according to my own ideas, established in one place, than I
found it was become necessary to remove to another. I&nbsp;wandered from
town to town during an interval of thirteen years. Sometimes I
re-visited <i>Glamorgan</i>; but my vanity had been too much flattered
by the past, and my hopes too much raised by the expectation of the
future, to allow me to doubt for a moment that fortune would not pour
into my lap, and that it would be always time enough for me to lay by a
sufficient provision for the support and comfort of my old age.</p>

<p>“I repaired at length to London, and displayed my talents there; but,
to my utter astonishment, I&nbsp;played for more applause than gain.
Here my sun of glory would have probably <ins class = "correction" title
= "text unchanged: error for set">sat</ins>, had not the Count
d’Adhemar, at that time Ambassador from the Court of France, become,
unsolicited, the most liberal of my patrons. On his discovering that my
circumstances were not adequate to the expences of my existence, and, as
he was pleased to add, to my merit, he deputed me the bearer of a
private letter which he addressed to the Queen, who failed not at
<i>Versailles</i> to distinguish his recommendation with marks of her
most zealous approbation. I&nbsp;had the honour to attend her Majesty,
and to give her some lessons on her favourite harp. She was particularly
charmed with the sweetness of the Scots ballads, which were unknown in
that kingdom; nor did some of the old Welsh ditties fail to delight her
ear. She vouchsafed in commiserating my infirmity, to alleviate its
anguish, and soon gave me a preference over the French masters, under
whose instructions she had not made the proficiency to which her
brilliant talents were fully competent. In this situation I should have
probably remained, had not envy, that loves not merit, darted its
smooth-tongued venom on a creature whose only offence was misfortune; an
offence the more dangerous, as in her generous heart it superseded every
other consideration.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page403" id = "page403">403</a></span>
<p>“The Queen ordered her Treasurer to give me a rouleau of fifty
Louis-d’ors, and condescended to say that she was so well satisfied with
the instructions I had given her, that she dismissed me against her
inclination, and did so only in compliance with the discontent of my
competitor, who found himself mortified that a foreigner, and
particularly an Englishman, should have obtained her protection to his
prejudice.</p>

<p>“But my pride had received a wound that was not to be healed in
France. For my disgrace various might be the causes assigned, and
perhaps the only real one concealed compliment to Monsieur
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. I determined therefore to return to Glamorgan,
and found on my arrival there that Evans was lately dead; and from some
hints that had been dropped by Sir Herbert Williams, it appeared
probable that it was his wish for me to succeed him. Of this I was
informed by Julia, who had been frequently noticed by Sir Herbert and
his son, Mr. Williams, who sometimes called in at my father’s house, and
heard Julia with pleasure touch the harp, which she accompanied with a
voice sweet and melodious, though not powerful.</p>

<p>“A few days after my return, Sir Herbert sent for me, and I was of
necessity accompanied by my daughter. He enquired into my story; and on
finding me disgusted with travelling, which could not afford to me the
smallest share of that satisfaction experienced from it by the rest of
mankind, he proposed my settling at Swansea; and from the double motive
of compassion for my situation, and his having been accustomed by Evans
to the enjoyment of music, he immediately settled on me an annuity of
fifty pounds for my life, and gave me the apartment that had been
occupied by my predecessor.</p>

<p>“In the following year my father died, and Julia remained unprovided
for. I&nbsp;knew not how to dispose of her; and to send her to London,
where she had no friends, was repugnant to my feelings. She was young,
susceptible, and, I&nbsp;was told, handsome; add so these, her affection
for me would not allow the idea of our separation, and she took up for
the present her abode at a friend’s house, in Swansea, and employed
herself with such work as Sir Herbert’s housekeeper chose to give her,
more for the disposition of her time than for any emolument she could
derive from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“Sir Herbert had one daughter married in Scotland, who seldom or ever
visited him; and his only son, who lived with him, had imbibed, from the
example of his father, since the death of Lady Williams, a&nbsp;love for
solitude, and a partiality for Swansea, that prevented his wishes from
roving beyond it. The old English hospitality prevailed in their house,
but its visitors were confined to their poorer neighbours, who always
found a welcome in&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“There was a communication through a shrubbery into a part of Sir
Herbert’s house, in which was my apartment. From thence my Julia could
steal unperceived there, when at times she wished to visit me,
unrestrained by the necessary formalities of dress or the being observed
by the family<ins class = "correction"

ostentatious grandees; and, when an exile among the hardy Thebans, he
carried heavier burdens than the broadest shouldered porter in <ins
class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for Bœotia">Bœtia</ins>. At Lacedemon his palate relished the black broth of
Sparta; among the dissolute Thracians, those sensual swine of Epicurus’s
stye, the greyest veteran of Venus made one sacrifice, less than he; and
in all the taverns of Thrace, Bacchus could not recognize a more thirsty
toper.</p>

<p>If we deduct from Alchibiades his compliance with vicious customs, no
model of conduct, can be mere worthy imitation and praise. Since the æra
of Chesterfield, a&nbsp;dissembling nobleman, who possibly pushed the
praise of flexibility of manners too far, accommodation has been
acrimoniously censured; and the narrow Knox, in his dogmatizing essays
has asserted, that the meanest selfishness is the parent of versatility.
But, though the Tunbridge teacher, ostentatiously vaunts of his intimacy
with the Bible, he forgot that Paul of Tarsus, whose knowledge of the
world was as indubitable as his piety, exhorts to “become all things to
all men, if by any means we may gain some.” Paul was no less a gentleman
than saint; and his knowledge of the world taught him the propriety of
varying his means to secure the end, and to become a most accommodating
apostle. Hence his compliment to Agrippa, for his skill in the
jurisprudence of Judea. Hence his adroitness in persuading the
superstitious men of Athens, that the Being they, and he worshipped,
were the same. Hence he could charm both the courtly Felix, and the
camp-bred centurion.</p>

<p>If the art of pleasing be worth practice in society, then will the
praises of versatility be fully justified. He who in
<span class = "pagenum">404b</span>
conversation, adheres to topics peculiar to himself, or to a profession,
<ins class = "correction" title = "missing word">is</ins> deservedly
dubbed pedant; and all unite in frowning upon him, by whom all are
equally neglected. Minds of the first energy, may sometimes effect the
unyielding quality of the oak, rather than the suppleness of the ozier.
A&nbsp;cardinal Ximenes, a&nbsp;chancellor Thurlow, and a secretary
Pitt, may be “original and <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘unaccomodating’">unaccommodating</ins>.” But he, whom every circle
courts, is that Proteus in demeanour, who can with the same ease that he
shifts his shoe, mutilate, or increase his bows, accordingly, as he
associates with the cit, or the courrier. The object of our fondest
admiration is the man of letters and the man of the world blended, who
can sublimely speculate with science in the morning, and agreeably
trifle with ladies at night. Of this class is Charles Cameleon. The
“omnis homo” of Horace, the “all accomplished” of Pope Charles, when at
school, was equally the darling of the scholars, on the first form, and
the truants on the lower. He could repeat the five declensions with
promptitude, and then drive hoop, or toss balls alertly. With the same
facility, could he make correct latin, and high flying kites. Unaided by
the “ladder to Parnassus,” he would now ascend to the summit of
Virgilian verse, and now grovel in the mire, to win marbles of every
sportive schoolfellow. At the university he heard morning prayers with
the saddened sedateness of a Pharisee, argued with tutors on personal
identity, as if inspired by the very spirit of Locke&mdash;and, on
syllogistic ground, vanquished every Aristotelean adversary. At noon you
might see him sauntering with loungers, and kindling a smile even in
vacancy’s face. The declining sun left him deploring, that twilight
should snap speculation’s thread; or compel him to leave unfinished the
song to <i>Myra</i>; and when the college bell tolled twelve, his
convivial club chose Charles president, and the room would echo
with,</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“Since we’ve tarried all day to drink down the Sun,</p>
<p>“Let’s tarry, and drink down the Stars.”</p>
</div>

<p>Educated for the bar, Cameleon is now an eloquent and employed
advocate. But year-books and entries, cannot preclude the system of
Sydenham, and Saurin’s sermons. An apothecary, hearing him harrangue
upon the superiority of Brown to Boerhave, mistakes him for a regular
bred physician, and asks, when he received a medical degree from
Edinburgh. Charles is intimately conversant with all the fathers of the
church, repeats whole pages from Justin Martyr, and quotes St. Gregory
on good works with more readiness than the parson. As he converses with
the grave, or the gay, he is alternately a believer, and a sceptic: and
one Sunday, after acknowledging to a devout deacon, that the internal
evidence of christianity was its chief corner stone; when afternoon
service was over, he agreed, to please a disciple of Voltaire, that the
clashing testimony of four evangelists, completely corroded the
<i>root</i> of our religion. Among the ladies, he holds most gracefully
“’twixt his finger and thumb, a&nbsp;pouncet box,” and chatters on
Canterbury-gowns and French millinery, like a fop of France. To a lover
of the fine arts, quotes Hogarth’s “analysis of beauty,” and viewing
Trumbull’s celebrated painting of the sortie from Gibralter, the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page405" id = "page405">405</a></span>
artist acknowledged that he talked of lights and shades more rapidly and
correctly than himself. In a club of wits, he declaims Shakespeare, in a
style of <i>Garrick</i>, he repeats original poems, the very gems of
fancy, and sets the “table on a roar” with merry tales, and ludicrous
combination. The eye of every reveller brightens at his approach, and
when he retires, Milton’s invocation to Mirth is unanimously
applied:</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“Haste thee <span class = "smallcaps">Charles</span> and bring with

<h4>INTERESTING STORY OF MADELAINE.</h4>

<p class = "center smallest">BY HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS.</p>

<p class = "center smaller">
[Concluded from <a href = "#page399">page 399</a>.]</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Madelaine</span> passed the
remaining part of the winter in the convent of &mdash;&mdash;, during
which period she received frequent letters from Auguste; and when spring
arrived he conjured her, instead of removing to her own province, to
remain a little longer in her present situation; and flattered her with
hopes of being able ere long to fulfil those engagements upon which all
his happiness depended.</p>

<p>In the summer of this year an event took place which will render that
summer forever memorable. The French nation, too enlightened to bear any
longer those monstrous oppressions which ignorance of its just rights
alone had tolerated, shook off its fetters, and the revolution was
accomplished.</p>

<p>Madelaine was a firm friend to the revolution, which she was told had
made every Frenchman free. “And if every Frenchman is free,” thought
Madelaine, “surely every Frenchman may marry the woman he loves.” It
appeared to Madelaine, that, putting all political considerations,
points upon which she had not much meditated, out of the question,
obtaining liberty of choice in marriage was alone well worth the trouble
of a revolution; and she was as warm a patriot from this single idea, as
if she had studied the declaration of rights made by the Constituent
Assembly, in all its extent and consequences.</p>

<p>The Count de &mdash;&mdash;, who was informed of the correspondence
between the two lovers, and who saw little hopes of his son’s subduing a
passion which this intercourse of letters served to cherish, contrived
means to have Auguste’s letters intercepted at the convent. In vain
Madelaine enquired with all the anxiety of tenderness for letters. In
vain she counted the hours till the return of the post-days. Post after
post arrived, and brought no tidings of Auguste. Three months passed in
the cruel torments of anxiety and suspense, and were at length succeeded
by despair. Madelaine believed she was forgotten&mdash;forgotten by
Auguste!&mdash;She consulted her own heart, and it seemed to her
impossible; yet, after a silence of three months, she could doubt no
longer.</p>

<p>Poor Madelaine now recollected with anguish, instead of pleasure that
all Frenchmen were free. She would have
<span class = "pagenum">405b</span>
found some sad consolation in believing that all Frenchmen were slaves.
It would have been some alleviation of her sorrows if Auguste had been
forced to abandon her; and she fancied she could have borne to lose him,
if she had been sure that he still loved her&mdash;it was losing him by
his own fault that filled her heart with pangs almost insupportable.</p>

<p>The little pittance which Madelaine, after paying her father’s debts,
had left for her own support, was insufficient to defray her expenses as
a pensioner in the convent. She had already, by her sweetness and
gentleness, gained the affections of some of the nuns, to whom she was
also attached, and who incessantly conjured her to take the veil. “And
why,” she sometimes exclaimed, “why should I hesitate any longer in so
doing? Since Auguste is lost, what have I to regret in renouncing the
world? What sacrifice do I make? what happiness do I resign?”</p>

<p>Madelaine had no ties to the world, of which she knew but little: but
to separate herself irrecoverably, and for ever, from him to whom her
soul was devoted&mdash;to see him, to hear his voice no more&mdash;to
take vows which would make it even a crime to think of him&mdash;to
banish him even from her thoughts&mdash;alas! Madelaine felt like
Eloisa&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>“All is not Heav’n’s while Abelard has part,</p>
<p>Still rebel nature holds out half my heart!”</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, too, the idea occured, that Auguste might love her
still&mdash;“And am I then,” thought Madelaine, “going to reduce myself
to a state in which I shall be forced to wish he were unfaithful, in
order to save me from the agonies of remorse!”&mdash;She put off all
thoughts of entering on her novitiate for some weeks longer&mdash;no
letters arrived, and again her resolution to take the veil <ins class =
"correction" title = ". missing">returned.</ins> “Why,” cried she, “why
should I still continue to lament that inconstant lover who thinks of me
no more! Alas, alas, did he not see the anguish of my soul at parting
with him?&mdash;Does he not know the deserted situation in which I am
left?&mdash;Oh, yes! he knows I have no other refuge, no other resource,
than taking the veil&mdash;no doubt he wishes to hear I have done
so&mdash;he will find in my renunciation of the world some excuse for
his infidelity&mdash;Oh, heavens! will Auguste hear then that I am
separated from him for ever without one sigh?&mdash;Ah, why need I
deliberate any longer?&mdash;My trials will soon be past&mdash;I feel
that my heart will break&mdash;yes, death will come to my
relief&mdash;and in heaven I shall find my father!”</p>

<p>Madelaine, at length, determined to join the holy sisterhood of the
convent. The white veil for her novitiate was prepared. The day was
fixed; when, prostrate with her face towards the earth, and with flowers
scattered over her, and a part of her long tresses cut off, she was to
enter upon that solemn trial preparatory to her eternal renunciation of
the world&mdash;of Auguste!</p>

<p>A few days before that which was appointed for the ceremony,
Madelaine was called to the parlour, where she found her lover, with
some of the municipal officers of the town, wearing their national
scarfs.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page406" id = "page406">406</a></span>
<p>Madeline, at the sight of Auguste, with difficulty reached a chair,
in which she fell back senseless; while Auguste could not forbear
uttering some imprecations against the iron gate by which they were
separated, and which prevented him from flying to her assistance. He,
however, procured help, and Madelaine recovered.</p>

<p>One of the municipal officers then informed her, that they had
received the day before a decree of the National Assembly, forbidding
any nuns to be professed. He added, that the municipality had already
given information of this new law to the abbess, who had consented to
allow Madelaine to leave the convent immediately. As he pronounced these
last words, Madelaine looked at her lover. Auguste hastened to explain
to her that his uncle, who loved him, and pitied his sufferings, had at
length made a will, leaving him his fortune, upon condition that his
father consented to his marriage with Madelaine.</p>

<p>When her lover and the municipal officers departed, Madelaine retired
to her apartment, to give way to those delicious tears which were poured
from a heart overflowing with wonder, thankfulness, and joy. When her
first emotions had subsided, she began to pack up her little wardrobe in
preparation for leaving the convent on the following day. “I&nbsp;always
loved the revolution,” thought Madelaine, as she laid aside the white
gown in which she was to be married the next morning; “and this last
decree is surely of all others the best and wisest&mdash;but if it had
come too late!&mdash;&mdash;” At this idea Madelaine took up the veil
for her novitiate, which lay upon her table, and bathed it with a flood
of tears.</p>

<p>The next morning Auguste and Madelaine were married in the parish
church of &mdash;&mdash;, and immediately after the ceremony set out for
Paris; where they now live, and are, I&nbsp;am told, two of the happiest
people, and the best patriots in France.</p>

<h4>IVAR AND MATILDA.</h4>

<p class = "center smaller extended">A TRADITIONAL TALE IN THE ISLE OF
MAN.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> the thirteenth
century, Ivar, a young and gallant knight, was enamoured of the
beauteous Matilda. Her birth and fortune were inferior; but his generous
mind disdained such distinctions. He loved, and was most ardently
beloved. The sanction of the king was alone wanting to consummate their
happiness. To obtain this, Ivar, in obedience to the custom of the
island, presented his bride to Reginald, a&nbsp;gay and amorous prince;
who, struck with the beauty and innocence of Matilda, heightened by an
air of modesty, immediately, for some pretended crimes, banished Ivar
from his presence, and by violence detained the virgin. Grief and
indignation alternately swelled her bosom; till, from the excess of
anguish she sunk into a state of insensibility. On awakening, her virtue
was insulted by the approaches of the tyrant. She was, however, deaf to
his insinuations, and only smiled at his menaces. Irritated at her
contempt, and flattering himself that severity would subdue her truth
<span class = "pagenum">406b</span>
and chastity, he imprisoned her in the most solitary apartment of the
castle; where, for some months, she passed the tedious night and day in
tears; far more solicitous for the fate of Ivar, than afflicted by her
own misfortunes.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Ivar, failing in an attempt to revenge his
injuries, assumed the monastic habit, and retired into Rushen Abbey.
Here he dedicated his life to piety; but his heart was still devoted to
Matilda. For her he sighed; for her he wept; and, to indulge his sorrows
without restraint, would frequently withdraw into the gloomiest
solitudes. In one of those solitary rambles he discovered a grotto,
which had been long unfrequented. The gloom and silence of this
retirement corresponding with the anguish of his mind, he sauntered
onward, without reflecting where the subterraneous path might conduct
him. His imagination was pourtraying the graces of Matilda, while his
heart was bleeding for her sufferings. From this reverie of woe, he was,
however, soon awoke, by the shrieks of a female. Advancing eagerly, he
heard in a voice nearly exhausted&mdash;“Mother of God! save Matilda!”
while, through a chink in the barrier that now separated them, he saw
the virgin, with dishevelled hair and throbbing bosom, about to be
sacrificed to the lust and violence of Reginald. Rage and madness gave
new energy to Ivar; who, forcing a passage through the barrier, rushed
upon the tyrant; and, seizing his sword, which lay carelessly on the
table, plunged it into its master’s bosom.</p>

<p>The tyrant died; and the lovers, through this subterraneous
communication, escaped to the sea-side, where they fortunately met with
a boat which conveyed them to Ireland: and in that kingdom the remainder
of their years was devoted to the most exquisite of all human
felicities; the raptures of a generous love, heightened by mutual
admiration and gratitude.</p>

<p>This is the substance of the tradition; but, according to some of the
Manks records, Reginald was slain by Ivar, not in the castle of Rushen,
but in a neighbouring meadow. This variation of the scene, however, does
not materially affect the credit of the tradition; as the Manks
historians impute Reginald’s death, not so much to Ivar’s ambition, as
to his revenge of private injuries.</p>

FRENCH REVOLUTION.</p>

<hr class = "w075">

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Madame Lafayette.</h5>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">This</span> lady, the wife
of a man whose history is blended with two important revolutions, was a
marchioness before the late changes in France; the family name of her
husband was also both spelled and pronounced differently, being then De
la Fayette; but the <i>de</i> being a mark of nobility, as having a
feudal allusion (the French term it, a&nbsp;<i>nomme de terre</i>) it
was, of course, omitted on the extinction of titles.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page407" id = "page407">407</a></span>
<p>Madame Lafayette is an eminent instance of the instability of
greatness, the mutability of fortune, and the inefficacy of wealth.
Descended from an ancient lineage, united to an amiable and illustrious
husband, who possessed estates in Europe, America, and the West-Indies;
she, nevertheless, has not been exempted from the must bitter calamities
that can afflict suffering humanity.</p>

<p>When Lafayette resisted the commands of the sole remaining legitimate
power in France, his “widowed wife” was arrested. Under the despotism of
Robespierre, she escaped death only by a miracle (part of her family was
actually immolated to his vengeance) but what to some will appear more
terrible, she experienced an unremitting captivity of fifteen months,
during which, she suffered all the horrors of a close confinement, being
immured within four walls, subjected to a scanty and precarious diet,
secluded from her children, and prohibited even from the light of
heaven.</p>

<p>On the death of the tyrant, the voice of humanity was once more
heard, and she was liberated, and restored to the arms of her afflicted
daughters. But she was a wife as well as a mother! and her beloved
husband was still in bondage; for he who had endeavoured to avert the
execution of Louis XVI. (such is the gratitude of courts) was
languishing in an Austrian prison!</p>

<p>She accordingly repaired to Hamburgh, accompanied by her children
only, for she had not wealth sufficient to hire a single domestic, and
she possesses a lofty sense of independence, which taught her to reject
pecuniary assistance, even from her few remaining friends. As soon as
her health was a little restored, she posted to Vienna, and prostrated
herself at the feet of the <ins class = "correction"

<p>Francis III. is in the flower of his youth. The chilling hand of age
has not yet rendered him morose; and surely <i>victory</i> cannot have
blunted his feelings, and made him at once haughty and insensible! No!
no! there is not a prince of his house, from the obscure count de
Hapsburg, of a former period, to the late powerful tenant of the
Imperial diadem, who has had more occasion to find and to feel that he
is a <i>man</i>.</p>

<p>Weeping beauty did not supplicate in vain; the German monarch raised
her from her lowly posture, and promised better days. With his
permission, she flew on the wings of affection, and, strengthened by
conjugal love, knocked at the gate of the fortress that confined her
dearly beloved husband, whose speedy deliverance (vain idea!) she hoped
instantly to announce.</p>

<p>The massive bolts of the dungeon give way, the grating hinges of the
iron doors pierce the ears; she and her virgin daughters are eyed,
searched, rifled, by an odious and horrible gaoler; and those, who, but
a moment before, deemed themselves deliverers, now find themselves
captives!</p>

<p>Reclining in the bottom of thy dungeon, these tears cannot be seen,
these sighs cannot be heard, nor can the quick decay of youth and
beauty, cankered in the bloom, and dissolving amidst the horrors of a
German prison, be contemplated. But the heart of sympathy throbs for
you, ye lovely
<span class = "pagenum">407b</span>
mourners; the indignation of mankind is aroused; the present age
shudders at your unmerited sufferings; and posterity will shed a
generous tear at their recital. Anguish may not yet rend the bosoms of
your persecutors, but a dreadful <i>futurity</i> awaits them, and, were
it possible to escape the scourge of offended heaven, they will yet
experience all the vengeance of indignant history!</p>

be so, from mere speculation! He was selected by Roland on account of
his industry and talents; and was put by him at the head of the

<h4 class = "smallcaps">Of the KNOWLEDGE of the WORLD,</h4>

<p class = "center smallest extended">WITH RESPECT TO THE FOLLIES AND
VICES OF IT.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> business of
education would be very easy, if the world, into which a young man is to
be introduced, was such as one would wish it to be. No person could then
fail of being well educated; for the world itself would, in general, be
his best instructor: every irregularity would then be sufficiently
punished and corrected by the natural consequences of it, and sufficient
encouragement would be given to every virtue by its own present reward.
But the difficulty is to train up a person to act with prudence and
virtue in a foolish and vicious age, and to prepare his mind properly
for such scenes of vice and folly as he must be witness to. With the
best precautions there will be some hazard in this case, but the hazard
will certainly be lessened by proper care and attention.</p>

<p>It appears to me that nothing is gained by deceiving a young person
in this case. I&nbsp;would not chuse to represent the manners of the
world as better than they are: because, upon that plan, it would be
impossible that my pupil should be sufficiently upon his guard against
their infection. It would be like committing him with an enemy, of whom
he had no previous knowledge.</p>

<p>Let a young man, therefore, be faithfully apprized of the great
variety of characters of which the world consists; that none are
absolutely perfect; that those who approach to perfection are few; that
the bulk of mankind are very imperfect, and many, but not the majority,
exceedingly profligate, deceitful, and wicked: and if, while he was
under the immediate care of his parents, and tutors, the principles of
virtue were carefully instilled into him, if he has been shewn the
inconveniencies and miseries that men actually bring upon themselves by
their vices in this life, and has been taught firmly to believe the much
greater miseries that await them hereafter, it may be hoped that the ill
example of some may have as favourable an effect upon him as the good
example of others.</p>

<p>But though a young person may be <i>told</i> what the world is, and
what men are, without disguise, it will be necessary that his actual
introduction into the world at large be managed
<span class = "pagenum">409b</span>
with great caution; because the address and insinuations of many persons
into whose company he may fall, and whose morals are very faulty, may be
more dangerous than he can possibly have any idea of beforehand; so that
no previous admonition will be a sufficient security for him. Let the
greatest care, therefore, be taken that the first <i>company</i> into
which a young person is introduced, be decent and virtuous, like that of
his parents and tutors; and, if it be possible, let him be kept from
having any connexion with those who are greatly abandoned and
profligate, till his own habits are in some good measure confirmed; and
then he will not chuse their society more than the common forms of
civility, which are necessary to an intercourse with mankind, and which
are unavoidable.</p>

<p>It would be happy if some vices, of a peculiarly unnatural and
atrocious kind, could be entirely concealed from the knowledge of young
persons; and, with care, it may perhaps be done, till they be too old to
be in much danger from temptation to them. In general, however,
I&nbsp;would neither conceal from young persons the knowledge of vice,
nor deny that temporal advantages and pleasures may attend vicious
indulgencies; but let them be always given to understand, that those
advantages and pleasures are dearly purchased; and that, though, for a
time, no visible inconvenience may attend the career of vice, the time
of <i>recompence</i> will surely overtake the votaries of it at last;
and that no man will ever violate the rules of temperance, chastity, or
any other virtue, without being made sufficiently to repent
of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>With respect to indulgencies which are not vicious, except in excess,
as frequenting the theatre, and places of public diversion, &amp;c.
there will be less danger of contracting an excessive fondness for them,
if they have been made familiar to the eye, and the mind, in early life.
The value of every thing of this kind is always greatly enhanced by the
rarity and novelty of them, by being considered as fashionable, and
allowed as an extraordinary favour. Were these artificial charms
removed, and sufficiently manly employment provided for youth, so that
they should not be at a loss what to do so kill their time, there would
be no great danger of their giving <ins class = "correction" title =
"one word">into</ins> that excessively dissipated mode of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page410" id = "page410">410</a></span>
life, in which too many persons of fortune are immersed at present.</p>

<p>A life of <i>pleasure</i>, as it is improperly called, never fails to
have most dreadful intervals of languor and disappointment, and
generally leads to vice and wretchedness. When the common amusements
have lost their <i>stimulus</i>, so that plays, operas, and assemblies,
can hardly keep the men of pleasure awake, and when they have had a
surfeit of all sensual indulgence, they have no resource but
<i>gaming</i>. Without this they have no object that can sufficiently
rouse and keep up their attention; and though the practice of gaming,
could it be kept within reasonable bounds, might serve to enliven a dull
hour, and amuse agreeably, and even usefully, persons who are incapable
of active and serious employment, or other persons in the intervals of
such employment; yet the progress from <i>less to more</i> is too easy,
and too tempting in this business; and <i>high gaming</i> is the
greatest enemy to every thing tranquil, gentle, benevolent, and
generous, in the human breast. It cherishes every passion that has any
thing sordid, dark, and malignant in it; so that when carried to excess,
and joined to disappointment, it is no wonder that it ends in riot,
distraction, despair, and self-murder.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“I was</span> one morning
expecting her at the usual hour, and for the first time she disappointed
me. I&nbsp;waited for her in vain, and toward evening began to grow
alarmed at her absence. I&nbsp;borrowed the arm of a servant, and
repaired to her lodging. She had not been seen there since the morning;
and after leaving a message for her, I&nbsp;returned home, under the
certainty of finding her there. But no one had seen her, neither did I
hear from her till the following evening, when she entered my apartment,
and I could discover, from the trembling agitation of her voice, that
something particular had disturbed her. On my questioning her about the
disposal of her time during the preceding day, I&nbsp;found that her
answers were vague and incoherent, which, on my observing, the native
candour of her heart prevailed, and she eagerly asked me if I could
forgive her revealing to me a secret that had got the better of her
reason, and without too harshly condemning, advise her how to act under
the present embarrassing state of her mind?&mdash;I was so totally
thunderstruck by this preparation, that I could only entreat her
instantly to satisfy me&mdash;but to my first emotion surprize, terror,
every sensation that could proceed from the honesty of my heart
succeeded, while she uttered&mdash;“Your Julia has dared to aspire to
the son of her father’s benefactor.”&mdash;I
<span class = "pagenum">410b</span>
interrupted her, and for a moment all my past affection for her was
buried in the most bitter resentment.</p>

<p>“She conjured me to hear her, and I promised to do so. “Yes,” she
continued, “your daughter has listened to the most tender professions of
honourable love, but she is bold to say that she could despise <span
class = "smallroman">HIM</span> who has offered it, had he even hinted
at the destruction of her innocence. Mr. Williams has privately and
frequently met me. He has pledged his honor that he will never give his
hand to another; but he expresses himself too well convinced of your
integrity, and gratitude to his father, to entrust you with a secret,
which it is most essential to his views should never be discovered by
him.”</p>

<p>I entreated my daughter to leave me, while I ruminated what measures
I could adopt to secure my own esteem, without betraying Mr. Williams.
I&nbsp;determined to see him; for how was it possible my Julia should
suffer in his esteem by the candid declaration she had made me?&mdash;I
requested the honour of half an hour’s private conversation with him in
my apartment the same evening, and I had no reason to repent my
sincerity. He was ingenuous in the extreme, and in a few minutes
dispelled the anxiety, (I&nbsp;will not say doubt) that my daughter’s
first words had occasioned. He declared to me, in the most solemn
manner, his unalterable resolution of uniting himself to her, whenever
he should be at liberty to declare his choice, which was restrained for
the present, both by his father and his uncle; from the latter he had
only to combat with pecuniary considerations; but for his father he had
the most tender affection, and the idea of distressing him would have
been nearly as terrible as that of forsaking the darling object to whom
I perceived, but too plainly, he was forever devoted.</p>

<p>“Mr. Williams’s confidence demanded the fullest return of mine; but
my honor was deeply interested, and to his I consigned the care
of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“After many conferences, and meetings between us, (during which he
saw not Julia) he consented to my urgent request, that of unbosoming our
situation to Sir Herbert. Mr. Williams, with all the impetuosity of
youth, believed what he hoped; and left to me the hardest task for the
human heart to perform, that of wilfully risking the displeasure of its
first benefactor.</p>

<p>“Sir Herbert heard my recital with more emotion than surprize; and I
could discover that the obstacles he held forth to his son’s union with
my daughter, were not so entirely on his own account as that of the Lady
Williams’s brother, the old Admiral Clayton; who having no children, had
declared his nephew his heir, but who possessed too much pride of blood
to listen to the proposal of an alliance, that would not be at least
adequate to his own.</p>

<p>“To this sentiment he added great inflexibility of temper, and a mind
bordering on suspicion. Sir Herbert thought it would, therefore, be
prudent to remove my daughter, and was generous enough to propose my
going with her, though he deprived himself by it of what afforded his
principal delight in the Winter Evenings. He recommended Chepstow, where
we have remained ever since, nor have I ever
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page411" id = "page411">411</a></span>
left her, but for six weeks at the return of Christmas, when I regularly
go for that time to Sir Herbert’s house.</p>

<p>“Mr. Williams still perseveres in his intention, and Sir Herbert does
not oppose a correspondence, that he knows would be in vain to prohibit.
Once, indeed, Mr. Williams has visited us here, and has given us every
reason to believe, that the death of the Admiral, who is now in his 75th
year, is the only barrier to his wishes, and I most candidly acknowledge
to my own.”</p>

<p>Here ended the Narrator; and Julia, who had been all the time absent,
returned to gladden us with her presence.</p>

<p>She saw that her secret was discovered; and having no farther
restraint in my society, soon convinced me that her whole happiness was
wound up in her future prospects, a&nbsp;disappointment in which would
not fail to embitter, if not actually destroy,&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>In a few months my wandering stars compelled me to leave Chepstow;
but, alas, they have never served to light me to happiness! My
correspondence with Julia has continued ever since uninterrupted; and
the Admiral, though not deprived of existence, is become so far dead to
the world by the suspension of his faculties, that Sir Herbert having
come to the knowledge of his will being made wholly in favour of Mr.
Williams, no longer withheld his happiness, but united him to his
long-loved Julia.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Williams took up their residence in his house, and the
latter days of the aged Llewyllin, who lived with them, were crowned
with content; while, like Israel’s Monarch, he turned the dulcet strains
of his harp to the divinest melody&mdash;the praises of his God.</p>

been defined, by certain acute wits the art of being adroitly deceived,
perhaps, therefore, no order in society merits congratulation more, than
that cajoled cluster of “good easy men,” whom knaves call dupes. Amadis
de Gaul, or any other knight errant of old romance, must have cordially
cursed the malignant enchanter, who, by the touch of a tallisman, caused
the gorgeous castle to dwindle to a cot, or the wrinkles of a witch to
mar the brow of a peerless damsel. The Dupe, whom the unreflecting

harangued in praise of ignorance; although I cannot print paradoxes,
like <span class = "smallcaps">Rousseau</span>’s, pronouncing the arts
and sciences useless, and barbarism a blessing; yet I would fervently
implore those gamesome genii, who delight in the mockery of mortals,
that they would never unbind from my eyes that fillet which conceals
from their view the foibles of the friend I respect, and the frailties
of the woman I love. In life’s pilgrimage, curiosity must be sparingly
indulged: and, lest dejection invade, we should not scarcely see, still
less contemplate, the deformities of <span class =
"smallcaps">Zaara</span>, or <i>The Desart</i>. One of the most amiable
<i>weaknesses,</i> as the world calls them, in my uncle Toby’s
character, as delineated by Sterne, was that you might cheat him ten
times a day, if nine times were not sufficient for your purpose. Ælian,
a&nbsp;narrative Greek, records the case of an insane Athenian, who,
living in a maritime town, fancied that all the vessels which arrived in
the haven were his own. Horace mentions likewise, a&nbsp;nobleman of
Argos, a&nbsp;literary enthusiast, a&nbsp;“child of fancy,” who, even in
the vacant pit, fancied that he witnessed the representation of sublime
tragedies, and “hearkened even to extacy.” Now how unfortunate an
officer would uncle Toby have been, had Corporal Trim hinted at the
duplicity of Bridget, widow Wadman, or any of the Shandy family; and how
unfortunate were the frantic Athenian and the illustrious Argive, from
whose minds the “dear deceit” was expelled by the officious friend, and
the operative hellebore.</p>

<p>I have read somewhere, I believe in Sir Thomas More’s works, that the
world is undone by looking at things at a
<span class = "pagenum">412b</span>
distance. One would suppose that so wise a Chancellor would have
philosophised better than this, and have maintained the <i>reverse</i>
of the proposition. Happy would it have been had his practice militated
with his principles. If he had surveyed the Romish superstition, and the
caprice of the eighth Henry <i>at a distance</i>, if he had kneeled to
the saints without questioning their right to be worshipped, and obeyed
the king without asking wherefore; the “rays of royal indignation,”
would not have confused the Chancellor, and he would not have paid with
his head the price of <i>too near</i> an examination.</p>

<p>The inimitable <span class = "smallcaps">Butler</span>, in whose
Hudibras we always find much of the good sense and truth of poetry,
acknowledges that,</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>Doubtless the pleasure is as great</p>
<p>Of being cheated, as to cheat.</p>
</div>

<p>But he might have said more, and affirmed that the satisfaction is
greater, and that the dupe is happier, than the knave. It is better to
be the gulled spectator of a puppet show, than the master juggler, who
comprehends the whole trick. How foolishly conducts that curious
impertinent, who swears that the glittering crown of the theatrical
monarch is nothing but tinsel, and rallies behind the scenes to view the
actors in an undress. For the naked skeleton, even of delight to adopt a
happy phrase of Dr. Johnson’s, is loathsome; and those inquisitive
beings, who wish to survey every object stripped of its trappings,
resemble children who dash their gilded toys to pieces to know what is
inside.</p>

<p>In every age inquisitiveness has caused many, eager to take a peep,
to go on their way sorrowing. If our <ins class = "correction" title =
"two words">grand parent</ins> Eve had been content with innocent
ignorance, and not <i>hankered</i> after those cursed crab apples which
have “set the children’s teeth on edge,” we should all be “jolly
fellows;” each, after rising from the feast of life, would have no
reckoning but his own to discharge. But since the habit of tearing off
the veil from every object has grown inveterate, how many <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘mishapen’">misshapen</ins> monsters have
exhibited to the curious eye, most naked and nauseous disproportion. How
many noble, how many ecclesiastical heads, recent from the guillotine,
have gasped on the ground because <span class = "smallcaps">Tom
Paine</span> railed at the mob for their servility to the ruling powers,
and taught them the “Rights of Man.” If <i>happy</i> ignorance had been
our hereditary queen, no persecution, civil or religious, would have
urged non-conforming victims to the stake or the scaffold. The bells on
St. Bartholomew’s night would not have tolled, Luther would not have
defaced so many paintings, nor have mutilated so many statues of the
Romish Church. Calvin’s proselytes would have been a visionary band,
feeble and insignificant as the madcap shakers. <i>Mother Church</i>
would never have quarrelled with her <i>daughters</i> for precedency.
<i>Lawn sleeves</i> would not have been rent by one side, nor <i>grey
coats</i> singed threadbare by the other; but all the members of the

<p class = "inset smallest">DEAREST SISTER,</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Your</span> last, so
fraught with genuine distress, arrived at a moment when my whole soul
was agitated by a pathetic fact, which has recently occurred in this
city.&mdash;Alas, my dear girl, it is not you alone whom calamity
visits:&mdash;the sons and daughters of affliction are as numerous as
the votaries of humanity:&mdash;Sympathy need never be idle; and the
tear of pity may unceasingly trickle from the eye of tenderness, while
bigotry, avarice, and vanity violate the susceptive bosom of innocence
and love.</p>

<p>Since our establishment in this city, among the acquaintances we have
formed, a&nbsp;family of the name of Williams, consisting of a
respectable father and mother, and three dutiful sons, has not been the
least flattering and agreeable. My earliest observation in it, was the
sincere passion which the eldest son constantly avowed for a
neighbouring female, whose parents, though not in the habit of intimacy
with his, were ever cordial and polite to his addresses. A&nbsp;mutual
and unvaried affection had subsisted between them from their infancy,
and, “growing with their growth,” the time had now arrived in which they
anticipated the unbounded fruition of their juvenile hopes. Their
parents, having heretofore tacitly acquiesced in their union, beheld
with unutterable pleasure the ceaseless constancy of their children,
which could be productive of nothing but the most unmingled happiness to
all. The day of festive gladness was appointed, and Mr. Williams, in
order to equalize his son’s estate with the expected affluence of his
daughter-in-law, purchased an elegant house, and furnished it with every
article of grandeur and convenience; besides a handsome donation in
cash, which he reserved for the day of celebration. The blissful and
expectant hour opened to the warm feelings of the young lovers a
thousand scenes of untasted joy&mdash;a thousand sources of ineffable
delight. Louisa already looked upon Henry as the plighted husband of her
soul, and poured into his bosom her unrestrained confidence; while he,
with feelings equally elated, made her the supreme mistress of his
thoughts!&mdash;Thus did the rapturous scene glow in their vivid
imaginations, and tantalize expectation, when the sordid parents of
Louisa, taking her to their closet, thus addressed her:&mdash;“Dear
Louisa, your happiness and future comfort being the only hope and object
of our lives, we have with pleasure beheld, and cherished with parental
indulgence, the virtuous passion you have long felt for Henry Williams.
In three days more our period of duty and authority will expire; and
before this we earnestly wish, by one dictate of prudence, well to
conclude the work ever nighest our hearts.”&mdash;The astonished Louisa,
unable to discern the tendency of this ambiguous exordium, remained
pensively silent; and
<span class = "pagenum">413b</span>
her father continued:&mdash;“You know the disparity of young Williams’
fortune, and the thoughtlessness of men of his profession and
years&mdash;Let us then beseech you as you regard your future welfare
and our solemn request, the last perhaps we shall ever enjoin, previous
to your marriage, to call for an attorney and confirm on your children
the fortune left you by your uncle: what we are able to bestow will
equal, if not exceed the fortune of your husband.”&mdash;Louisa was all
comprehension, and looking with an eye of affection first at her
attentive mother, and then her father, she exclaimed, “Is it possible,
father, that he, to whose honour and fidelity I am to commit my person
and precious happiness, is deemed unworthy to be trusted with a trifling
sum of paltry gold!”&mdash;and turning, with a sigh acceded to the
proposition of her parents, as the only means of reconciling them to
participate in their approaching bliss. An attorney was obtained, and
her fortune of five thousand pounds secured to the offspring of her
legal marriage, and forever wrested from the touch of her husband.</p>

<p>Their exulting parents beheld the nigh approach of their children’s
happiness, with accumulated transport! The enraptured Henry forsook the
world; and devoted his time to the retired society of his amiable
Louisa;&mdash;Louisa disclosed the ungenerous deed she had been obliged
to perform.&mdash;Its suspicious aspect, and concealed process, enraged
the pride of his soul!&mdash;He flew to his father, related the
insiduous act, and with aggravated frenzy cursed the foul and penurious
machination!&mdash;His father, naturally of a high and independent
spirit, heard his son with mortified ambition, and in flames of
vindictive manliness hastened to the presence of the parents of
Louisa&mdash;They received him with cordiality; but their demeanour was
soon changed into coldness and reproach, by his unbridled vehemence; and
after a clamorous altercation, in which the agonized Louisa mingled her
tears, he left them with a solemn denunciation of the match, and an
imprecation on their iniquitous penury. All intercourse between the
parties was interdicted; the house, furniture, &amp;c. purchased by Mr.
Williams, re-sold, and the intended solemnization annihilated.</p>

<p>&mdash;Here, Caroline, pause, and enquire of your soul, if this
horrid tale could thus conclude? Say, my sister, is it possible to your
conception, that the divine and unadulterated fervor of this young pair,
could, by this interposition of avarice, be resolved into apathy and
indifference?<span class = "locked">---</span>Could that celestial
passion, whose weakest votary has survived the shocks of fate, become
extinct by a mere artifice and parental covetousness?<span class =
"locked">---</span>No, Caroline, it is inconsistent with nature, and
nature’s God.</p>

<p>Louisa’s anguish at this disastrous event is not to be
described!&mdash;After uttering her grief in the agony of tears and
lamentation, she drooped into a settled melancholy. Immured in her
chamber, and refusing the comfort of the world, her lonely reflections
aggravated the deletary influence of her misfortune: She gradually
declined; and in a few months, her relentless parents beheld the awful
advances of their child’s dissolution; which she viewed with a placed
benignity of soul. “Death, like a friend” indeed, seemed to succour her
affliction: and by a gradual and mild operation,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page414" id = "page414">414</a></span>
terminated the bitter pangs of her heart. Yet even at the solemn period
of her decline, her mind dwelt on the constancy and love of Henry with
delightful extacy; and in departing from her sorrowing friends, forever
closed her quivering lips in pronouncing his beloved name! Her fate
reached the ears of the frantic Henry, who, until this time, had been
kept ignorant even of her indisposition! He flew to the house&mdash;but
at first was denied this last sad pleasure of beholding his lifeless
Louisa!&mdash;He was, however, admitted for a few minutes, on cruel
conditions. Leaning on the arm of his younger brother as he crossed the
aisle which conducted to the solemn apartment, his weakened senses
started at the melancholy idea, and for a time an universal agony
rendered him unconscious of his real situation.&mdash;He entered the
darkened room, and approaching the coffin, beheld his lately blooming
love beautiful even in the frozen arms of death!&mdash;“Oh!” he
exclaimed; but his surcharged heart gushing from his eyes, obstructed
the farther utterance of his grief. He gazed on the cold eloquence of
her face; touched with his hand her palsied cheek; and with a kiss whose
ardor seemed to breath his soul to the object, was dragged from the
tragic spectacle!</p>

<p>He attended the funeral rites; and since has been continually
absorbed in silent sorrow! His soul, at times, seems abstracted from his
body, and in relapsing from his reveries, he often fervently exclaims,
“I&nbsp;have seen my Louisa! She is with her kindred spirits in bliss;
and I shall soon be happy!”&mdash;While he thus paces in pursuit of the
same grave which incloses his hopes of life and felicity, his loving
parents, oppressed with age and affliction, are hourly progressing
towards their end. Sorrow has raised her banner in the family; while the
parents of Louisa, in performing the pageantry of mourning, forget the
cause and object of their grief.</p>

<p>From this interesting narrative, my love, you will perceive, that,
although others of your sex endure not the same distresses to which you
are destined, they are not wholly exempt from the asperities of fate.
Alas, be not covetous of distress: but learn from this reflection, that
all are either the Victims of Sentiment or the dupes of passion,
desirable it is to acquire a mind patient in suffering, and a soul
indignant of complaint.</p>

<h4>DETRACTION. A VISION.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Superior</span> excellence
is the general mark for calumny; and envy is usually led to asperse what
it cannot imitate. A&nbsp;little mind is scandalized at the pre-eminence
of its neighbour, and endeavours to depreciate the virtues which it
cannot attain to. Thus the distempered eye is impatient of prevailing
brightness; and, by attempting to observe the lucid object,
inadvertently betrays its own weakness. Pride is the fruitful parent of
Detraction; and it is the unjust estimate which men set upon themselves,
that generates in their minds this ridiculous contempt of greater worth.
Persons of this unhappy complexion regard all praises conferred upon
another as derogatory from their own value. The arrows of the backbiter
are generally shot in the night; and the most unspotted innocence is the
game of this infernal destroyer. The heads of his darts are imbrued in
poison; and it too frequently happens, that a small wound proves mortal
to the injured. But to drop for the present these figurative
expressions, I&nbsp;would only observe, that it is a pity a
well-regulated society cannot more effectually curb this impious
licentiousness of those sons of darkness. If a wretch, <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘necessiated’">necessitated</ins> by the
cries of a starving family to seek illegal supplies of bread, shall make
an open attack upon me, the constitution of the realm consigns such a
pitiable malefactor to infamy and death. And shall this miserable object
of compassion prove the victim of my <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘rensentment’">resentment</ins>; while the backbiter may, with
impunity, revel in the excesses of his iniquity, and boast defiance to
all laws? As this is a topic, however, which has been descanted on by a
variety of pens, I&nbsp;shall endeavour to enliven it with the air of
novelty, by throwing my farther sentiments into the form of a
vision.</p>

<p>I found myself, during the slumbers of the night, in a very extensive
region, which was subject to the jurisdiction of a fury, named
Detraction. The fields were wild, and carried not the least appearance
of cultivation. The tops of the hills were covered with snow; and the
whole country seemed to mourn the inclement severity of one eternal
winter. Instead of the verdure of pleasing herbage, there sprang up to
sight hemlock, aconite, and other baneful plants. The woods were the
retreats of serpents; while on the boughs were perched the birds of
night, brooding in doleful silence.</p>

<p>In the middle of the plain was a bleak mountain, where I discovered a
groupe of figures, which I presently made up to. The summit presented
the fury of the place. There was a peculiar deformity attending her
person. Her eyes were galled and inflamed; her visage was swoln and
terrible; and from her mouth proceeded a two-edged sword. A&nbsp;blasted
oak was the throne which she sat on; her food was the flesh of vipers,
and her drink gall and vinegar.</p>

<p>At a little distance from her I observed Ignorance talking loud in
his own applause; Pride strutting upon his tiptoes; Conceit practising
at a mirror; and Envy, like a vulture, preying upon herself.</p>

<p>The multitudes who paid their addresses to this fury were a
composition of all nations and professions, of different
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page415" id = "page415">415</a></span>
characters, and various capacities. There was the mechanic, the
tradesman, the scholar; but the most zealous votaries consisted
principally of old maids, antiquated batchelors, discarded courtiers,
and the like. Each strove to ingratiate himself with the fury, by
sacrificing the most valuable of his friends; nor could proximity of
blood move compassion, or plead exemption from being victims to her
insatiable passion. Some addressed this infernal Moloch with the very
fruits of their bodies; while others were triumphantly chanting forth
the extent of her power, and expatiating on the numbers of her
conquests. At this incident arose in my breast all the tender sentiments
of humanity that I had ever cultivated; and I began to blame my criminal
curiosity, which had prompted me to ascend the mountain. But in a few
minutes the whole scene was very agreeably reversed. For, towards the
southern boundaries, I&nbsp;observed the clouds parting, the sky
purpling, and the sun breaking forth in all its glory. When immediately
there appeared marching towards us Good-nature, in all her pomp and
splendor; arrayed like a sylvan nymph, and blooming with unstudied
graces. She was of a fair and ruddy complexion, which received
additional beauty from the frequent smiles that she threw into her
countenance. On her right hand shone Good Sense, with much majesty and
diffidence in her mien. She was an essential attendant on the young
lady, who never appeared to such advantage, as when she was under her
more immediate direction. On her left was Generosity, carrying a heart
in her hand. The next that presented, was Modesty, with her eyes fixed
on the ground, and her cheeks spread with roses. Then followed a train
of beauties, who, by the unaffected charms of their persons, made me
desirous of a nearer inspection. Upon a close approach,
I&nbsp;discovered that they were a tribe of <span class =
"smallcaps">American ladies</span>, who were always fond of appearing in
the retinue of the Goddess, from whose indulgent smiles they received an
accessional lustre to their charms. I&nbsp;then turned my eyes towards
the monsters I have above described; the principal of which turned pale,
and fell down in a swoon from her throne. Pride sunk into a shade; Envy
fell prostrate and bit the ground; while Ignorance vanished like a
morning cloud before the rising sun. As the Goddess drew near, the whole
collection of fiends disappeared. The basilisk skulked into the glade,
and the oak on which the fury was seated budded forth afresh. Wherever
the goddess walked, the flowers sprang up spontaneous at her feet. The
trees, surprized with new-born life, displayed the enamelled blossom.
The tender roe was seen bounding over the mountains, and the little lamb
sporting on the hills. Instead of the briar and the thorn, there shot
forth the myrtle and every odoriferous shrub. The voice of the turtle
was heard in the groves, and the dales resounded with the melodious
harmony of the nightingale. In a word, the whole reign confessed the
happy influences of the Deity, and charmed in all the genial softness of
the spring.</p>

<p class = "center smaller">WRITTEN TO DISSUADE A YOUNG LADY FROM
FREQUENTING<br>
THE TOMB OF HER DECEASED LOVER.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Now</span>, thro’ the dusky
air, on leaden wings,</p>
<p class = "indent">Sails the sad night, in blackest clouds array’d;</p>
<p>Hark! in the breeze the gathering tempest sings;</p>
<p class = "indent">How dear it murmurs in the rustling shade!</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Loud, and more loud, is heard the bursting sound</p>
<p class = "indent">Of thunder, and the peal of distant rain;</p>
<p>While lightnings, gliding o’er the wild profound,</p>
<p class = "indent">Fire the broad bosom of the dashing main.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Now dies the voice of village mirth; no more</p>
<p class = "indent">Is seen the friendly lantern’s glimmering light;</p>
<p>Safe in his cot, the shepherd bars his door</p>
<p class = "indent">On thee, Eliza! and the storm of night.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
In yon sequester’d grove, whose sullen shade</p>
<p class = "indent">Sighs deeply to the blast, dost thou remain,</p>
<p>Still faithful to the spot, where he is laid,</p>
<p class = "indent">For whom the tears of <i>beauty</i> flow in
vain?</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Ah, left alone beneath the dreadful gloom,</p>
<p class = "indent">Companion of the tempest! left alone!</p>
<p>I see thee, sad-reclining o’er the tomb,</p>
<p class = "indent">A pallid form, and wedded to the stone!</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Ah! what avails it, Sorrow’s gentlest child,</p>
<p class = "indent">To wet the unfruitful urn with many a tear;</p>
<p>To call on Edward’s name, with accents wild,</p>
<p class = "indent">And bid his phantom from the grave appear?</p>

<p class = "stanza">
No gliding spirit skim the dreary ground,</p>
<p class = "indent">Dress the green turf, or animate the gloom,</p>
<p>No soft aerial music swells around,</p>
<p class = "indent">Nor voice of sadness murmurs from the tomb.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Cold is the breast that glow’d with love, and pale</p>
<p class = "indent">The cheek that, like the morning, blush’d
before:</p>
<p>Mute are the lips that told the flattering tale,</p>
<p class = "indent">And rayless is the eye that flattered more.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Deep, deep beneath the dark mysterious grave,</p>
<p class = "indent">Thy tears he sees not, nor can hear thy sighs:</p>
<p>Deaf is thine Edward, as the Atlantic wave,</p>
<p class = "indent">Cold as the blast that reads the polar skies.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Oh! turn, and seek some sheltering kind retreat;</p>
<p class = "indent">Bleak howls the wind, and deadly is the dew:</p>
<p>No pitying star, to guide thy weary feet,</p>
<p class = "indent">Breaks thro’ the void of darkness on thy view.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Think on the dangers that attend thy way!</p>
<p class = "indent">The gulf deep-yawning, and the treacherous
flood;</p>
<p>The midnight ruffian, prowling for his prey,</p>
<p class = "indent">Fiend of despair, and darkness, grim with blood!</p>

<p class = "stanza">
But oh! if thoughts terrific fail to move,</p>
<p class = "indent">Let Pity win thee back to thine above;</p>
<p>Melt at a sister’s tears, a mother’s love,</p>
<p class = "indent">Aw’d by the voice of Reason, and of God!</p>

<p class = "stanza">
But no&mdash;thy haunt cannot be there</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Nor, wanton, dost thou love to sport,</p>

<p>Over the gem-imbossed vase,</p>

Thou fly’st th’ intoxicating bowl,</p>

Ah, modest Health, from scenes like these,</p>
<p class = "indent">Thou turn’st thy steps aside, to haste</p>

<p class = "indent">Its spirit-giving breath to taste;</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Where bath’d in view some valley lies,</p>
<p class = "indent">Or up a mountain’s woody rise&mdash;</p>
<p>Whence stretching to the eastern sky,</p>
<p class = "indent">Bright rural prospects greet the eye.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Here, a deep forest widely spread,</p>
<p class = "indent">Its variegated foliage shows,&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>There, rolling thro’ a flowery mead,</p>
<p class = "indent">With rapid course, a river flows</p>

<p class = "stanza">
On to the sea&mdash;where meets the view</p>
<p class = "indent">Thro’ opening hills its bosom blue,</p>
<p>Save when a white-sail flies the gale before,</p>
<p class = "indent">Or a wave breaks upon the rocky shore.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
And as thou dart’st thy looks around,</p>
<p class = "indent">O’er the lively landscape smiling,</p>
<p>More blythe the ploughman’s carols sound,</p>
<p class = "indent">His tedious furrow’d way beguiling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "stanza">
More sweet the birds their songs renew,&mdash;</p>
<p class = "indent">More fresh each blooming flowret’s
hue&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>From every valley springs, without alloy,</p>
<p class = "indent">A general cheerfulness&mdash;a burst of joy.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>:</p>
<p>English text:<br>
While thus mournfully ruminating, Marina, on a sudden, heard the sound
of a rustic flute. Attentively listening, she soon heard an harmonious
voice, deploring, in plaintive strains, the infidelity of his mistress,
and the miseries of disappointed love.</p>

<p>French text:<br>
Comme elle disait ces mots, elle entendit au bas de la grotte le son
d’une flûte champêtre; elle écoute; et bientôt une voix douce, mais sans
culture, chante sur un air rustique ces paroles:</p>

<b>Notes</b>: Critical Review, February 1796, referring to a passage
from pg. <a href = "#page386">386</a>: “One of the licensed abuses which
our author animadverts upon&mdash;the insolence of servants, to whom it
is not immediately convenient for the master or mistress to pay
<i>exorbitant</i> wages due to them&mdash;might be easily obviated, if
those, who call themselves their superiors, would have the discretion to
confine their expenses within their incomes. We are aware that this is
an unfashionable maxim: but the neglect of it necessarily involves
consequences still more serious than those which Mrs. Gooch has
stated&mdash;the insolence of <i>vulgar tradesmen</i> superadded to that
of servants, and ultimate turpitude, disgrace, and ruin.”</p>
