<h4><i>THE LADIES’ MONITOR.</i></h4>

<p class = "center smallest extended">
ADDRESSED TO EVERY FAIR READER, WHETHER SINGLE OR MARRIED.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A multitude</span> of
admirers is an object too generally coveted by young females, yet it is
certainly a very improper method to be taken by such as wish to be happy
in matrimony. Sensible and well-meaning, worthy and sincere men, are
seldom attracted within the circle of those who adopt this conduct; if
they should fall within it, it is very seldom that they long retain the
slight chains of such a love.&mdash;In particular, it is remarkably
improper and absurd for a woman, who has already a sensible lover, to
languish for a number of flatterers to admire her<span class =
"locked">---</span>should she miss of her aim, she fancies herself
unhappy: should she succeed, she is likely to be really so. A&nbsp;man
who values his own honour, or the dignity proper for the female whom he
addresses to assume, will by no means admit of this plurality of lovers,
any more than the laws will admit of a plurality of husbands.</p>

<p>A neatness, without excess, in point of dress, a prudent restraint of
the tongue, a&nbsp;moderation in taking diversions, and an unaffected
ease and politeness, joined to the usual accomplishments, must complete
the character of an accomplished lady in a single state; and will, in
the end, outweigh the transitory, though delightful charms of a
beautiful person.</p>

<p>However, it frequently happens that women, as soon as they are
married, seem to think their task is entirely done, yet it is no less
common for them to find that it is just then to begin again. It is often
an easier matter to win a man than to keep him; and those who have found
little trouble in conquering a sweetheart, have had no small difficulty
in preserving the affections of a husband.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is nothing more proper, than to observe,
with the utmost nicety, the temper of the person to whom you are to be
joined in matrimony<span class = "locked">---</span>For this is the very
key to happiness in that state, and if it be not found, all other
efforts will be ineffectual. It is in vain to conclude, that, from the
apparent disposition of the former lover, you may draw that of the
husband. It is not so, it cannot be so; for, besides that the best
humours of the former are only seen, circumstances being
<span class = "pagenum">97b</span>
altered, will doubtless make an apparent alteration in the same person,
to which the knowledge of his natural disposition must lead you. It is
to this alone you must expect to owe that empire which you wish to
maintain over the heart you have conquered; though, amongst the variety
of dispositions observeable in men, there are but few, where an even
mildness on the side of the female, will best secure her sway; and she
will always rule most perfectly, who seems not ambitious of
governing<span class = "locked">---</span>Jealousy is what every married
woman should beware of; when once she admits of it, she treasures up
anxiety in her mind<span class = "locked">---</span>Should she entertain
it in her bosom, it will be perpetually preying, as it were, upon her
vitals; if she is imprudent enough to avow it, there will ever be found
a number of officious people, who will fill her ears with tales which
will destroy her peace. The fond wife will then be looked upon as a kind
of domestic foe; for her husband will shun her accordingly, and whenever
they are together, they will be the mutual torment of each other.</p>

<h4><span class = "smaller">INTERESTING HISTORY OF</span><br>
<i>THE BARON DE LOVZINSKI.</i></h4>

<p class = "hanging smaller">
With a relation of the most remarkable occurrences in the life of the
celebrated <span class = "smallcaps">Count Pulaski</span>, well known as
the champion of American Liberty, and who bravely fell in its defence
before Savannah, 1779.</p>

<p class = "center smaller">
<i>Interspersed with Anecdotes of the late unfortunate <span class =
"smallcaps">King</span> of <span class = "smallcaps">Poland</span>, so
recently dethroned.</i></p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">My</span> history presents
a frightful example of the instability of fortune. It is indeed very
flattering, but it is also sometimes very dangerous, to have an ancient
title to sustain, and a large estate to preserve. The sole descendant of
an illustrious family, whose origin is lost in the darkness of remote
ages, I&nbsp;have a right to aspire to, and to occupy the first
employments in the republic which gave me birth, and yet I behold myself
condemned to languish in a foreign country, amidst an indolent and
inglorious obscurity.</p>

<p>The name of Lovzinski is honourably mentioned in the annals of
Poland, and that name is about to perish with myself! I&nbsp;know that
an austere philosophy either rejects or despises vain titles and
corrupting riches; and perhaps I should console myself if I had lost
only these; but, I&nbsp;weep for an adored spouse, I&nbsp;search after a
beloved daughter, and I shall never more revisit my native land. What
courage is capable of opposing griefs like mine?</p>

<p>My father, the Baron de Lovzinski, still more distinguished by his
virtues than his rank, enjoyed that consideration at court, which the
favour of the prince always confers, and which personal merit sometimes
obtains. He bestowed all the attention of a tender parent on the
education of my two sisters; and in regard to mine, he occupied himself
with the zeal of a man of family, jealous of the honour of his house, of
which I was the sole hope, and with the activity of a good citizen, who
desires nothing so ardently as to leave to the state a successor worthy
of him.</p>

<p>While I was pursuing my studies at Warsaw, the young P&mdash;&mdash;
distinguished himself among the rest of my companions by his amiable
qualities. To the charms of a person at once noble and engaging, he
joined the graces of a cultivated understanding. The uncommon address
which he displayed among us young warriors, that rare modesty with which
he seemed desirous to conceal his own merit from himself, on purpose to
exalt the abilities of his less fortunate rivals, who were generally
vanquished by him in all our exercises; the urbanity of his manners, and
the sweetness of his disposition, fixed the attention, commanded the
esteem, and rendered him the darling of that illustrious band of young
nobility, who partook of our studies and our pleasures.</p>

<p>To say that it was the resemblance of our characters, and the
sympathy of our dispositions, that occasioned my attachment to
M.&nbsp;de <span class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;</span> would be to pay
myself too flattering a compliment; however that may be, we both lived
together in the most intimate familiarity.</p>

<p>How happy, but how fleeting is that time of life, when one is
unacquainted with ambition, which sacrifices every thing to the desire
of fortune and the glory that follows in her train, and with love, the
supreme power of which
<span class = "pagenum">98b</span>
absorbs and <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for concentrates?">concentres</ins> all our faculties upon one sole object!
that age of innocent pleasures, and of confident credulity, when the
heart, as yet a novice, follows the impulse of youthful sensibility, and
bestows itself unreservedly upon the object of disinterested affection!
Then, surely, friendship is not a vain name!</p>

<p>The confidant of all the secrets of M. de P&mdash;&mdash;, I myself
undertook nothing without first intrusting him with my designs; his
counsels regulated my conduct, mine determined his resolution; our youth
had no pleasures which were not shared, no misfortunes which were not
solaced, by our mutual attachment.</p>

<p>With what chagrin did I not perceive that fatal moment arrive, when
my friend, obliged by the commands of a father to depart from Warsaw,
prepared to take leave of me! We promised to preserve for ever that
lively affection which had constituted the chief happiness of our youth,
and I rashly swore that the passions of a more advanced age should never
alter&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>What an immense void did the absence of M. de P&mdash;&mdash; leave
in my heart! At first it appeared that nothing could compensate for his
loss; the tenderness of a father, the caresses of my sisters, affected
me but feebly. I&nbsp;thought that no other method remained for me to
dissipate the irksomeness of my situation, than to occupy my leisure
moments with some useful pursuit. I&nbsp;therefore cultivated the French
language, already esteemed throughout all Europe; I&nbsp;read with
delight those famous works, the eternal monuments of genius, which it
had produced; and I wondered that, not withstanding such an ungrateful
idiom, so many celebrated poets, so many excellent philosophers and
historians, justly immortalized, had been able to distinguish themselves
by its means.</p>

<p>I also applied myself seriously to the study of geometry; I formed my
mind in a particular manner to the pursuit of that noble profession
which makes a hero at the expence of one hundred thousand unfortunates,
and which men less humane than valiant have called the grand art war!
Several years were employed in these pursuits, which are equally
difficult and laborious; in short, they solely occupied my thoughts.
M.&nbsp;de <span class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;</span>, who often
wrote to me, no longer received any but short replies, and our
correspondence began to languish by neglect, when at length love
finished the triumph over friendship.</p>

<p>My father had been for a long time intimately connected with Count
Pulaski. Celebrated for the austerity of his manners, famous on account
of the inflexibility of his virtues, which were truly republican,
Pulaski, at once a great captain and a brave soldier, had on more than
one occasion signalized his fiery courage, and his ardent
patriotism.</p>

<p>He trusted in ancient literature, he had been taught by history the
great lessons of a noble disinterestedness, an immoveable constancy, an
absolute devotion to glory. Like those heroes to whom idolatrous but
grateful Rome elevated altars, Pulaski would have sacrificed all his
property to the prosperity of his country; he would have spilled the
last drop of his blood for its defence; he would even have immolated his
only, his beloved daughter, Lodoiska.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page99" id = "page99">99</a></span>
<p>Lodoiska! how beautiful! how lovely! her dear name is always on my
lips, her adored remembrance will live for ever in my heart!</p>

<p>From the first moment that I saw this fair maid, I lived only for
her; I&nbsp;abandoned my studies; friendship was entirely forgotten.
I&nbsp;consecrated all my moments to Lodoiska. My father and hers could
not be long ignorant of my attachment; they did not chide me for it;
they must have approved it then? This idea appeared to me to be so well
founded, that I delivered myself up, without suspicion, to the sweet
passion that enchanted me: and I took my measures so well, that I beheld
Lodoiska almost daily, either at home, or in company with my sisters,
who loved her tenderly:&mdash;two sweet years flew away in this
manner.</p>

<p>At length Pulaski took me one day aside, and addressed me thus: “Your
father and myself have formed great hopes of you, which your conduct has
hitherto justified; I&nbsp;have long beheld you employing your youth in
studies equally useful and honourable. To-day&mdash;(He here perceived
that I was about to interrupt him) What would you say? Do you think to
tell me any thing I am unacquainted with? Do you think that I have
occasion to be hourly witness of your transports, to learn how much my
Lodoiska merits to be beloved? Is it because I know as well as you the
value of my daughter, that you never shall obtain but by meriting her?
Young man, learn that it is not sufficient that our foibles should be
legitimate, to be excusable; those of a good citizen ought to be turned
entirety to the profit of his country; love, even love itself, like the
basest of the passions, is either despicable or dangerous, if it does
not offer to generous hearts an additional motive to excite them towards
honour.</p>

<p>“Hear me: Our monarch, for a long time in a sickly habit of body,
seems at length to approach towards his end. His life, become every day
more precarious, has awakened the ambition of our neighbours. They
doubtless prepare to sow divisions among us; and they think that by
over-awing our suffrages, they will be enabled to force upon us a king
of their own chusing. Foreign troops have already dared to appear on the
frontiers of Poland; already two thousand Polish gentlemen have
assembled, on purpose to punish their audacious insolence. Go and join
yourself with those brave youths; go, and at the end of the campaign
return covered with the blood of our enemies, and shew to Pulaski a
son-in-law worthy of him!”</p>

<p>I did not hesitate a single moment; my father approved of my
resolutions, but being unable to consent without pain to my precipitate
departure, he pressed me for a long time against his bosom, while a
tender solicitude was depicted in all his looks; his adieus seemed to be
inauspicious; the trouble that agitated his heart seized upon my own;
our tears were mingled on his venerable cheeks. Pulaski, who was present
at this moving scene, stoically reproached us for what he termed a
weakness. Dry up your tears, said he to me, or preserve them for
Lodoiska: it belongs only to childish lovers who separate themselves
<span class = "pagenum">99b</span>
from each other for five or six months, to weep in this manner! He
instructed his daughter in my presence, both of my departure, and of the
motives which determined me to it. Lodoiska grew pale, sighed, looked at
her father with a face suffused with blushes, and then assured me in a
trembling voice, that her vows should be offered up for my safe return,
and that her happiness depended on the safety of Lovzinski.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">It</span> was a memorable
saying of Peter the Great; “I have civilized my country, but I cannot
civilize myself.” He was at times vehement and impetuous, and committed,
under the impulse of his fury, the most unwarrantable excesses; yet we
learn, that even he was known to tame his anger, and to rise superior to
the violence of his passions! Being one evening in a select company,
when something was said which gave him great offence, his rage suddenly
kindled, and rose to it’s utmost pitch: though he could not command his
first emotions, he had resolution enough to leave the company. He walked
bare-headed for some time, under the most violent agitation, in an
intense frosty air, stamping on the ground and beating his head with all
the marks of the greatest fury and passion; and did not return to the
company until he was quite composed.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Antiquarians</span> say,
that an old negro at Cape Cod, whenever his master required any thing of
him, would exclaim, “<i>Massa chuse it</i>.” Thence in time the name of

<p>The city of <i>Albany</i> was originally settled by Scotch people.
When strangers on their arrival there asked how the new comers did? the
answer was, “<i>All bonny</i>.” The spelling we find a little altered,
but not the sound.</p>

<p>When Julius Cæsar’s army lay encamped at <i>Ticonderoga</i>, near a
thousand years ago, the deserters were commonly tied up upon a battering
ram and flogged: When any culprit was brought out, the commanding
centurion would exclaim, <i>Tie on the rogue!</i> The name, we see, has
worn well.</p>

<p>A fat landlady, who about the time of the flight of Mahomet from
Mecca, lived between new Orleans and the Chicasaw cliffs, was scarcely
ever unfurnished with pigeon sea pye; and thence got the name of <i>Mrs.
Sea Pye</i>. The enormous river Mississipi, owes its name to the fat
landlady.</p>

seats of moss for their parents, shaded from the sun by green awnings,
on poles, round which were twined wreaths of flowers, breathing the
sweets of the spring. The surprise, the gaiety of the scene, the flow of
general joy, the sight of so many happy people, the countenances of the
enraptured parents, who seem to live anew again, the sprightly season of
youth in their children, with the benevolent looks of the noble
bestowers of the feast, filled my eyes with tears, and my swelling heart
with a sensation of pure, yet lively transport, to which the joys of the
courtly belles are mean.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">When</span> a man is
disposed to reveal a secret, and expects that it shall be kept, he
should first enquire whether he can keep it himself. This is good
advice, perhaps a little in the Irish way.</p>

<p>All the wisdom in the world will do little while a man wants presence
of mind. He cannot fence well that is not on his guard. Archimedes lost
his life by being too busy to give an answer.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the difference of estate and quality among men, there
is such a general mixture of good and evil, that in the main, happiness
is pretty equally distributed in the world. The rich are as often
unhappy as the poor, as repletion is more dangerous than appetite.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how fond we are of repeating a scrap of Latin, in
preference to the same sentiment in our own language equally well
expressed. Both the sense and words of Omnia vincit amor (love conquers
all) are worthy only of a school-boy, and yet how often repeated with an
affectation of wisdom!</p>

<p>Revenge, speaking botanically, may be termed wild justice, and ought
to be rooted out, as choaking up the true plant. A&nbsp;first wrong does
but offend the law, but revenge puts the law out of office. Surely, when
government is once established, revenge belongs only to the law.</p>

<p>For more than a century, has Billingsgate been proverbial for the
coarseness of its language. Whence is this? What connexion is there
between fresh fish and foul words? Why should the vending of that useful
commodity, and elegant luxury, prompt to oaths, execrations, and every
corruption of language, more than any other? And to think that the
parties concerned are of the fair sex<span class = "locked">---</span>O
fye!</p>

<p>Reason has not more admirers than there are hypocrites. Hypocrites
admire only the profits of wisdom, and approve just so much of her, as
is agreeable and serviceable to their ends.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“You</span> know that he
has been in our house some time ago, informing us of your exaltation to
the ducal dignity, and at the same time, placed the declaration of the
ghost, concerning the murder, in its proper point of view. However, you
are still ignorant of the most important circumstance. I&nbsp;will not
dwell on the uncommon praise he bestowed on your family, and you in
particular, but only mention that he concluded his panegyrics with the
observation, that the Countess herself would deem you deserving her
love, if she should be acquainted more intimately with your Grace. This
unexpected turn perplexed Amelia evidently. She replied, she did not
doubt the amiable qualities of the Duke, however she vowed eternal
fidelity to the Count. ‘If that is your sole objection,’ the Irishman
replied, ‘then I shall soon remove it. The deceased himself shall
release you from your vow, from the performance of which he can derive
neither benefit nor pleasure; it is in my power to make him declare it
himself.’ ‘No, no!’ exclaimed Amelia, terrified, ‘the rest of the
deceased shall not be interrupted; I&nbsp;should not be able to stand
the sight of him.’ ‘No apparition, my Lady,’ the Irishman replied, ‘you
shall neither hear nor see the deceased!’&mdash;With these words he took
a blank piece of paper out of his pocket-book, requesting Amelia to
write upon it the following words:&mdash;&mdash;‘Spirit of the Count of
Clairval, shall I preserve my heart and hand faithful to thee till
death, according to my vow?’ As soon as the Countess had been persuaded
to it with great difficulty, and wrote these words, the Irishman
prevailed upon her to carry the paper to an apartment to which no one
could have access without her knowledge and leave. Amelia chose the
apartment contiguous to her bed-chamber. The shutters were bolted from
within, the paper placed upon a table, and the room strongly fumigated
by the Irishman, who uttered some mysterious words. When they had
retired, the Irishman requested her to return and look after the paper;
however she could see nothing but the words written by herself, upon
which she shut the door, and put the key in her pocket.</p>

<p>“‘Sleep easy,’ the Irishman added, ‘and don’t open the chamber before
to-morrow morning, when you will find an answer to your question.’</p>

<p>“The Irishman left us at eleven o’clock, and Amelia went to her
bed-room, which she left not for a moment all night.&mdash;She went to
bed, but uneasiness and <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘curi-/sity’ at line break">curiosity</ins> did not suffer her to close
her eyes. Not the least noise was heard in the adjoining apartment, and
when Amelia entered it early in the morning, she had observed beneath
the lines she had wrote, pale but legible characters, which she
instantly knew to be the hand-writing of her deceased
Lord&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;‘Thy vow,
<span class = "pagenum">101b</span>
which binds me to be a living being upon earth, and, thee to one who is
deceased, shackles my liberty. I&nbsp;break these chains. The man by
whose orders I have been assassinated is Vasco**ellos.’</p>

<p>“Imagine how Amelia was astonished at an incident which evidently was
the effect of a superior power; the apartment, the shutters, and the
door of which had been carefully secured, and which was guarded by
Amelia herself, being entirely inaccessible to any mortal, except by
violent means, of which no traces could be perceived on the window
shutters. This miraculous event was decisive for my friend, who
professed herself entirely at liberty from that moment.</p>

<p>“Your Grace will easily believe me, that the tender attachment to
you, which had found access to her heart, guarded by a solemn vow,
acquired additional activity when the shackles were thrown off. The
ghost himself appeared to have silently approved, by naming the real
murderer, the passion for a Prince, whose father had been injured by an
unjust suspicion. Amelia endeavoured, nevertheless, to conceal from me
the real state of her heart, and, out of caprice, rather would leave me
to guess, than to confess herself, what might have been misinterpreted
as a weakness. However, that very constraint which she experienced by
concealing a secret that struggled to break its confinement, some words
which she dropped unknowingly, her gloomy looks and silent
melancholy&mdash;&mdash;in short, all those traits which seem to have
told you so very little of Amelia’s secret sentiments, convinced me soon
that love was the silent tormentor of her heart. I&nbsp;communicated my
discovery to her, and she confessed at last that I was not mistaken<ins
class = "correction" title = "text has ’">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“Gracious Heaven!” I exclaimed, <ins class = "correction" title =
"open quote missing">“she</ins> confessed<span class =
"locked">---</span>”</p>

<p>“And at the same time desired me earnestly to conceal it carefully
from you; and do you know for what reason?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Amelia feared she was not beloved by you. Your having proceeded on
your travels during her illness without so much as taking leave of her,
made her already suspect your indifference. This suspicion gained
additional strength by your never having wrote a single line to her
after your departure. Your behaviour during your present stay with us
too, has cured her of that error as little as the information of your
departure.”</p>

<p>“Should it be possible my love could have escaped Amelia’s
looks?”</p>

<p>“It did not escape my observation.&mdash;&mdash;I gathered carefully
all the marks of it, and communicated them to my friend. However, they
appeared to her to be nothing farther than proofs of gallantry, which
every well-educated man is wont to offer at the shrine of beauty. ‘Is it
possible,’ she said, ‘that true, ardent love, could refrain so long from
coming to an <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘expla-/tion’ at line break">explanation</ins>?’ And indeed, my Lord, can you say any
thing against this objection?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page102" id = "page102">102</a></span>
<p>“My Lady, I could not entertain the least idea of such an
explanation, while the misunderstanding concerning the murderer of Count
Clairval was not removed, although I had not been ignorant of the
residence of Amelia, which was unknown to me ever since the removal from
the castle in the forest, and the mysterious conduct of the Countess has
prevented me from declaring now, what I ardently wished to avow publicly
ever since I got acquainted with her. What has made <i>you</i> guess my
happiness has induced <i>me</i> to apprehend my
misfortune&mdash;&mdash;I even feared to offend the Countess by my
presence. I&nbsp;expected secret dislike to me, at most pity, but never
a return of my love.”</p>

<p>“I see you are but a novice in love,” Lady Delier said smiling, “and
I have of course acted wisely that I opened your eyes!”</p>

<p>“O! my dearest Baroness!” I replied, kissing her hand, my gratitude
will end only with my life.”</p>

<p>“Silence! Silence!” she exclaimed, putting her hand on my lips, <ins
class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“I</ins> have told
you, as yet, only good news&mdash;&mdash;the worst is coming now!”</p>

<p>“What can that be?” I asked with consternation.</p>

<p>“You shall hear Amelia’s own words: ‘The Duke’ said she, ‘does not
love me, and even if he should have a passion for me, and avow it, he
should hear the confession of my reciprocal tenderness, but never
receive my hand. I&nbsp;am indeed released of my vow, but my present
liberty will raise my fidelity to my deceased Lord, which was till now
mere duty, to merit, and I will remain constant to him, as far as it
will be in my power. I&nbsp;cannot command my love for the Duke, however
my hand is at my disposal.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! how you have damped my happiness!” I replied after a
painful pause.</p>

<p>“Should a mere whim of the Countess really be able to dishearten your
Grace? You do not consider how soon the love of a living adorer can
subdue the fidelity to a deceased husband. Amelia’s heart is yours, and
her hand will certainly follow.”</p>

<p>“It is not only this incertitude that makes me uneasy; the Countess
loves me because she cannot help it. Can a love which I do not owe to a
voluntary attachment render me happy?”</p>

<p>“How you are roving! what ought to make you proud and happy damps
your spirits. What was it that impelled Amelia irresistibly to love you?
can it have been any thing else but the consciousness of your
perfections, and an irresistible sympathy which has united your hearts;
and what can be more desirable, what more sincere and durable than such
bonds? My Lord, love has done every thing for you, and you have done
nothing for love. Disclose to Amelia your sentiments, communicate to her
your tenderness, and her involuntary attachment to you will soon be
changed into a voluntary passion.”</p>

<p>“My dearest friend! My comforter!” I exclaimed, “what friendly genius
is it that speaks through you, and animates my whole nature?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">102b</span>
<p>“The genius of love&mdash;I have loved too, and know how to advise in
affairs of the heart. But tell me sincerely, my Lord, would your father
consent to a match beneath your dignity?”</p>

<p>“It would be of no consequence if he should not; I am Duke.”</p>

<p>“I understand you; however I fear Amelia would never consent to a
union which should be destitute of the benediction of the Marquis of
Villa**al.”</p>

<p>“My father loves me, and he will never oppose his only son in a
matter upon which depends the happiness of his life.”</p>

<p>“Well then! I will leave you to your good fortune. I shall not fail
to contribute as much as is in my <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘pow-/power’ at line break">power</ins> to promote that union.
However, (added she with dignity) I&nbsp;expect from your candour, that
you will not misinterpret my interview with you, and the interest I take
in that affair.”</p>

<p>“I look upon it as a proof of your inestimable friendship.”</p>

<p>“O! my children!” the Countess resumed with great emotion,
“I&nbsp;love you as a mother. I&nbsp;could not bear any longer that two
people, who seem to have been born for each other, should misunderstand
one another in a manner so tormenting to both of you. You will render
Amelia happy, my Lord, or I am dreadfully mistaken in my opinion of you.
With this hope I put the fate of my friend entirely in your hands.
I&nbsp;confide to your care an angel, whose early improvement was my
work; and constitutes my pride, and whose perfections you scarcely know
by half. I&nbsp;entrust to you a being of the purest and most excellent
of hearts. Conclude from this, upon the confidence I repose in you.”</p>

<p>“I shall endeavour to deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Retire now, else we shall be surprised by Amelia; but take care not
to make her suspect our interview and conversation. You even must not
visit us this evening earlier than usual.”</p>

<p>I promised it, and retired. My whole frame had been in a feverish
tremor from the beginning of our conversation. I&nbsp;could scarcely
utter the most necessary answers to the discourses of the Baroness. To
be beloved by Amelia! This intelligence imparadised me, and my heart
could scarcely contain the unspeakable bliss which had been showered
down upon me. I&nbsp;went home like a dreaming person, went again
abroad, and my feet carried me, unknowing to me, to the spot whither a
secret impulse urged me to go. However, the severe command of the
Baroness had drawn a large circle around Amelia’s abode, which repelled
me. I&nbsp;hovered at the margin of it like a spell-bound spirit, and
sighed for the arrival of the appointed hour. Never had the setting in
of night been expected with more impatience, and the sun appeared to me
to retire unusually late from the horizon.</p>

<p>At length the wished-for hour arrived; however, the moment when I was
going to the house which contained all that was dear to me, an
unspeakable anxiety damped
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page103" id = "page103">103</a></span>
suddenly my rapturous joy. I&nbsp;had promised not to betray by my
behaviour the intelligence which the Baroness had imparted to me, and
yet I deemed it impossible to preserve such a dominion over myself if
the vehemency of my state of mind should not abate. This was the source
of my anxiety, which added to the danger of exposing myself, because it
deprived me of the small remnant of self dominion which my rapturous joy
had left me. I&nbsp;entered the house. The woman of the Countess told me
her Lady was in the garden. I&nbsp;went through several rows of trees
without finding her. The moon peeped now and then through the fleecy
clouds, and concealed her silvery orb again. The great extent of the
garden, and the impetuous state of my mind, increased the difficulty of
finding the idol of my heart. At length, stepping forth from a side
path, enclosed with high hedges, I&nbsp;fancied I saw something stirring
at a distance, near a statue. Having advanced some paces the light of
the moon reflected from the marble statue upon Amelia, removed every
doubt. I&nbsp;approached with tottering steps, and found Amelia
reclining against a pedestal of a Diana, and immersed in profound
meditation. The rustling of the dry leaves beneath my footsteps, roused
her from her reverie.</p>

<h4>REMARKS ON MUSIC.</h4>

<p class = "center smaller">
(Continued from <a href = "nos53_64.html#page91">page 91</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> present
universal passion for this art, and the fashion of making it a necessary
part of education, induces me to consider it as relating to the fair
sex, more particularly. Parents are naturally inclined to make their
children partake of those amusements the most prevailing and
fashionable. As music in this age comes under that denomination, it is
no wonder we find every attention paid to this qualification at the
earliest period of life. The most eminent masters are obtained; and much
time and expence bestowed to acquire this accomplishment. The fond
parent, anxious to embellish the darling child, and render her fit for
polite company, compels her to perseverance, without discriminating the
propensity of her own nature, but vainly imagines, that a proficiency is
certainly to be obtained in proportion to the reputation of her
instructor. Under this delusion the young lady is too often brought into
public company, and exhibits her own performance, to the well-bred,
amidst the admiration and astonishment of the ignorant many, and the
silent pity of the judicious few. Here again let us call to mind the
observation of Plutarch, and consider how far the manners of a people
are denoted by the state of their music. The present state of
dissipation in the fashionable world, and the agitation of spirits ever
attendant on crouded assemblies and pleasurable pursuits, elevate the
mind and taste
<span class = "pagenum">103b</span>
above the standard of sober thoughts. Every thing is sought which can
assist the temporary frenzy, and nothing deemed worth our knowing but
how to forget ourselves. This unhappy situation renders the generality
of our fashionable people lost to any serious examination of true or
false impression, while they are indiscriminately led to approve or
condemn whatever the multitude of fashion establishes by its sanction.
It is not now sought as a repose for the mind after its fatigues, but to
support its tumults; and the imagination is now to be surprised with the
wonderful execution of the performer, whilst the effect is totally
neglected.</p>

<p>Since the supreme Being has formed many of his most beautiful works
according to the principles of harmony, from whence some of our most
pure and affecting pleasures arise, can it be looked upon as unbecoming,
that our youth of both sexes should bestow some portion of their time to
the study of what was manifestly intended by Providence to allure us to
love of order, according to the Platonic doctrine quoted by Plutarch?
surely not; the younger part of the female sex, who discover the least
propensity to music, or shew any signs of having a good ear, should
certainly learn music, not for the sake of rendering these fit for the
fashionable world, nor for parade and ostentation; but should so learn
as to amuse their own family, and for that domestic comfort they were by
Providence designed to promote; and to relieve the anxieties and cares
of this life, to inspire cheerfulness, and elevate the mind to a sense
of love of order, virtue and religion.</p>

<h4 class = "smallcaps">On Singularity of Manners.</h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">There</span> are few people of such
mortified pretensions, as patiently to acquiesce under the total neglect
of mankind; nay so ambitious are most men of distinction, that they
chuse to be taken notice of, even far their absurdities, rather than to
be entirely overlooked, and lost in obscurity, and, if they despair of
exciting the attention of the world, by any brilliant or useful
accomplishment, they will endeavour to regain it by some ridiculous
peculiarity in their dress, their equipage or accoutrements.</p>

<p>But if we must distinguish ourselves from the rest of mankind, let it
be by our intrinsic virtue, our temperance and sobriety, and a
conscientious regard to every relative duty; but as we ought “to think
with the wise, and talk with the vulgar,” let us also act differently
from a great part of the world in matters of importance, but conform to
them in trifles. This is what Seneca so forcibly inculcates in his fifth
epistle to his friend Lucilius.</p>

<p>“I both approve of your conduct, and sincerely rejoice that you
resolutely exert yourself; and, laying aside every other pursuit, make
it your whole study to improve yourself in wisdom and virtue. And I not
only exhort, but earnestly intreat you to persevere in this course.</p>

<p>Give me leave however, to caution you not to imitate those pretended
philosophers, who are more solicitous to attract the notice of the
world, than to make a progress in wisdom; nor to affect any thing
singular in your dress, or in your manner of life. Avoid that
preposterous ambition of gaining applause, by your uncouth appearance,
your hair uncombed, and your beard neglected; nor be always declaiming
against the use of plate, of soft beds, or any thing of that kind. The
very name of a philosopher is sufficiently invidious, though managed
with the greatest modesty and discretion.</p>

<p>Suppose we have entered upon our stoical plan, and began to sequester
ourselves from the conversation and customs of the vulgar; let every
thing <i>within</i> be dissimilar; but let our <i>outward</i> appearance
be conformable
<span class = "pagenum">105b</span>
to the rest of the world. Let not our apparel be splendid or shewy, nor
yet mean or sordid. Let not our plate be embossed with gold; but let us
not imagine, that the mere want of such expensive plate is a sufficient
proof of our frugality. Let us endeavour to live a better life, not
merely a life contrary to that of the vulgar; otherwise, instead of
conciliating the favour of those whom we wish to reform, we shall excite
their aversion, and drive them from our company; we shall also deter
them from imitating us in any thing, when they are afraid that they are
to imitate us in every thing.</p>

<p>The first advantages which philosophy promises are, a just sense of
the common rights of mankind, humanity, and a sociable disposition; from
which advantages, singularity and dissimilar manners will entirely
seclude us. Let us beware, lest those peculiarities by which we hope to
excite the admiration, should expose us to the ridicule and aversion, of
mankind.</p>

<p>Our object is to live according to nature; but to torture our bodies,
to abhor cleanliness in our persons, when attended with no trouble, or
affect a cynical filthiness in our food; this sure is living contrary to
nature. As it is a mark of luxury to hunt after delicacies, to reject
the common unexpensive comforts of life is a degree of madness. Our
stoic philosophy requires us to be frugal, not to mortify ourselves; but
there is such a thing as an elegant frugality. This moderation is what I
would recommend.”</p>

<p class = "center smaller">
(Continued from <a href = "nos65_79.html#page99">page 99</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Encouraged</span> in this
manner, what dangers had I to fear? I departed accordingly, but in the
course of that campaign, there happened nothing worthy of narration; the
enemy, equally careful with ourselves to avoid any action which might
produce an open war between the two nations, contented themselves with
fatiguing us by means of frequent marches: we, on the other hand,
bounded our views to following and observing them; and they only seemed
to oppose themselves to us, in those parts where the open country
afforded them an opportunity of making good their retreat.</p>

<p>At the end of the campaign, they prepared to retire on purpose to
take up their winter-quarters in their own country; and our little army,
composed almost wholly of gentlemen, separated soon after.</p>

<p>I returned to Warsaw full of joy and impatience; I thought that Love
and Hymen were about to bestow Lodoiska on me.&mdash;&mdash;Alas!
I&nbsp;no longer had a father. I&nbsp;learned, on entering the capital,
that Lovzinski died of an apoplexy on the night before my arrival. Thus
I was deprived of even the sad consolation of receiving the last sighs
of the most tender of parents; I&nbsp;could only offer up my sorrows at
his tomb, which I bathed with my tears!</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;“It is not,” says Pulaski to me, who was but little
moved with my profound sorrow; “it is not by means of barren tears that
you can do honour to a father such as thine. Poland in him regrets a
Citizen&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;a&nbsp;hero, who would have been of
immense service during the critical moment which now approaches. Worn
out with a tedious malady, our monarch has not a fortnight to live, and
on the choice of his successor depends the happiness or misery of our
fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>“Of all the rights which the death of your father transmits to you,
the most noble is undoubtedly that of assisting at the Diet, in which
you are to represent him; it is there where he will revive in you; it is
there, where you ought to exhibit a courage infinitely more difficult to
be sustained than that which consists only in braving death in the field
of battle!</p>

<p>“The valour of a soldier is nothing more than a common virtue; but
they are not ordinary men who on awful emergencies, preserving a
tranquil courage, and displaying an active penetration, discover the
projects of the powerful who cabal, disconcert the enterprises of the
intriguing, and confront the designs of the factious; who, always firm,
incorruptible, and just, give not their suffrages but to those whom they
think most worthy of them; whom neither gold nor promises can seduce,
whom prayers cannot bend, whom menaces cannot terrify.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">106b</span>
<p>“These were the virtues which distinguished your father; this is the
precious inheritance which you ought to be desirous of sustaining. The
day on which the states assemble for the election of a king, will be the
epoch on which the pretensions of many of our fellow-citizens, more
occupied with their private interests than jealous of the prosperity of
their country, will be manifested, as well as the pernicious designs of
the neighbouring powers, whose cruel policy it is to destroy our
strength by dividing&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“I am deceived, my friend, if the fatal moment is not fast
approaching, which will for ever fix the destinies of our
country,&mdash;&mdash;its enemies have conspired its ruin; they have
secretly prepared for a revolution;&mdash;&mdash;but they shall not
consummate their purposes while my arm can sustain a sword! May that
God, who is the protector of the republic, prevent all the horrors of a
civil war! But that extremity, however frightful it appears, may perhaps
become necessary; I&nbsp;flatter myself that it will be but a short,
although perhaps a violent crisis, after which the regenerated state
will assume its ancient splendour.</p>

<p>“You shall second my efforts Lovzinski; the feeble interests of love
ought to disappear before more sacred claims. I&nbsp;cannot present my
daughter to you during this awful moment of suspense, when our common
country is in danger; but I promise to you, that the first days of peace
shall be marked by your union with Lodoiska.”</p>

<p>Pulaski did not speak in vain. I felt that I had now more essential
duties to fulfil than those of love; but the cares with which my mind
was occupied, were hardly able to alleviate my grief. I&nbsp;will even
avow to you, without blushing, that the sorrow of my sisters, their
tender friendship, and the caresses more reserved but no less pleasing
of my mistress, made a stronger impression on my heart than the
patriotic counsels of Pulaski. I&nbsp;beheld Lodoiska tenderly affected
with my irreparable loss, and as much afflicted as myself at the cruel
events which forced us to defer our union; my chagrin, by being thus
divided with that lovely woman, seemed insensibly to diminish.</p>

<p>In the mean time the king dies, and the Diet is convoked. On the day
that it was to open, at the very instant when I was about to repair to
the assembly, a&nbsp;stranger presented himself, and desired to speak to
me in private. As soon as my attendants were retired, he enters my
apartment with precipitation, throws himself into my arms, and tenderly
embraces me. It was M.&nbsp;de <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;!</span> Ten years, which had elapsed since our
separation, had not so much changed his features as to prevent me from
recognizing him, and testifying my joy and surprise at his unexpected
return.</p>

<p>“You will be more astonished,” says he to me, “when you know the
cause. I&nbsp;have arrived this instant, and am about to repair to the
meeting of the Diet;&mdash;would it be presuming too much on your
friendship to reckon on your vote?”</p>

<p>“On my vote! and for whom?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page107" id = "page107">107</a></span>
<p>“For myself,” continues he with vivacity; “it is not now time to
account to you the happy revolution that has taken place in my fortune,
and which at present permits me to entertain such exalted hopes: it is
sufficient to observe, that my ambition is at least justified by a
majority of suffrages, and that it is in vain that two feeble rivals
would attempt to dispute with me the crown to which I pretend.</p>

<p>“Lovzinski,” adds he, embracing me again, “if you were not my friend,
and I esteemed you less, perhaps I should endeavour to dazzle you by
means of promises; perhaps I should recount to you the favours which I
intend to heap upon you, the honourable distinctions that are reserved
for you, and the noble and glorious career that is about to offer itself
to your ambition;&mdash;&mdash;but I have not any need of seducing, and
I only with to persuade you.</p>

<p>“I behold it with grief, and you know it as well as myself, that for
several years past our Poland, become enfeebled, owes its safety to
nothing else than the distrust of the three great powers<a class = "tag"
name = "tag107a" id = "tag107a" href = "#note107a">*</a> which surround
it, and the desire to enrich themselves with our spoils, may in one
moment re-unite our divided enemies.</p>

<p>“Let us prevent, if we can, this inauspicious triumvirate from
dismembering the republic. Undoubtedly, in more fortunate times, our
ancestors were able to maintain the freedom of their elections; it is
necessary however that we should yield to that necessity which is become
inevitable.</p>

<p>“Russia will necessarily protect a king, whom she herself has
elevated; in receiving the sovereign of her choice, you will defeat the
views of that triple alliance which will render our perdition certain,
and we shall acquire a powerful ally, who will oppose herself with
success to the two enemies that remain to&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>“These are the reasons which have determined my conduct; I do not
abandon part of our rights, but to preserve the most precious of them.
I&nbsp;wish not to ascend a fickle throne, but with the intention, by
the means of a sage policy, to give it stability; I&nbsp;consent not to
alter the constitution of the commonwealth, but to preserve the kingdom
entire.”</p>

<p>We repaired to the Diet together; I voted for M. de P&mdash;&mdash;.
He in effect obtained the majority of the suffrages; but Pulaski,
Zuremba, and some others, declared themselves in favour of Prince <span
class = "locked">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>. Nothing was decided amidst the
tumult of this first meeting.</p>

<p>When the assembly broke up, M, de P&mdash;&mdash; invited me to
accompany him to the palace, which his secret emissaries had already
prepared for him in the capital<a class = "tag" name = "tag107b" id =
"tag107b" href = "#note107b">†</a>. We shut ourselves up together during
several hours, and renewed the promises of a friendship that should
endure for ever. I&nbsp;then too informed M. de <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;</span> of my intimate connection with Pulaski,
and of my love for Lodoiska. He repaid my confidence with more important
communications; he informed me of the events
<span class = "pagenum">107b</span>
which had led to his approaching grandeur; he explained to me his secret
designs; and I left him, convinced that he was less occupied with the
desire of his own elevation, than with that of restoring Poland to its
ancient prosperity.</p>

<p>Possessed with these ideas, I flew towards my future father-in-law,
burning with the desire of adding him to the party of my friend. Pulaski
was walking at a great pace up and down the chamber of his daughter, who
appeared equally agitated with himself.</p>

<p>“Behold,” said he to Lodoiska, the moment that he saw me enter,
“behold that man whom I esteem, and whom you love! He has sacrificed us
both to his blind friendship.” I&nbsp;was desirous to reply, but he went
on&mdash;“You have been connected from your childhood with M. de <span
class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;</span>. A&nbsp;powerful faction is
about to place him on the throne; you know you are acquainted with his
designs; this very morning, at the diet, you voted for him;&mdash;you
have deceived me:&mdash;but do you think that you shall deceive me with
impunity?”</p>

<p>I besought him to hear me, and he constrained himself so far as to
preserve a stern silence: I&nbsp;then informed him that M. de <span
class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;</span>, whom I had for a long time
neglected, had agreeably surprised me by his unexpected return.</p>

<p>Lodoiska appeared charmed to hear me commence my
justification.&mdash;“You shall not deceive me in the same manner as if
I were a credulous woman, says Pulaski.&mdash;But it signifies not<span
class = "locked">---</span>proceed.”</p>

<p>I then recounted to him the particulars of the short conversation
that I had with M. de <span class =
"locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span> before I repaired to the assembly
of the states.</p>

<p>“And these are your projects!” exclaims he. “M. de
P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; sees no other remedy for the misfortunes of his
fellow-citizens than their slavery! He proposes this, one of the name of
Lovzinski, approves of it; and they despise me so much as to tempt me to
enter into this infamous plot! Shall I behold the Russians commanding in
our provinces in the name of a Pole?”</p>

<p>“The Russians, say I with fury; the Russians reign in my country!” On
this Pulaski, advancing towards me with the greatest impetuosity, cries
out: “Perfidious youth! you have deceived me, and you would betray the
state! Leave my house this very moment, or know that I shall order you
to be dragged out of&nbsp;it!”</p>

<p>I frankly acknowledge that an affront so cruel, and so little
merited, disarmed me of my prudence: in the first transports of my fury,
I&nbsp;placed my hand upon my sword; and quicker than lightning Pulaski
brandished his in the air.</p>

<p>His daughter, his distracted daughter, rushed forward, and
precipitated herself upon me, crying out: “Lovzinski, what are you about
to do?” On hearing the accents of a voice so dear to me, I&nbsp;recalled
my wandering reason; but I perceived that a single instant was about for
ever to bereave me of my Lodoiska! She had left me to throw herself into
the arms of her father. He, cruel man, beheld my grief, and strove to
augment it: “Go, traitor!” says he, “be gone<span class =

<h4>REMARKS ON MUSIC.</h4>

<p class = "center smaller">
(Continued from <a href = "nos65_79.html#page103">page 103</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Music</span> is capable of
a variety so infinite, so greatly does the most simple differ from the
most complex, and so multiplied are the degrees between those two
extremes, that in no age could the incidents respecting that fascinating
art have been few or uninteresting: But, that accounts of these
incidents should be handed down to us, scanty and imperfect, is no
matter of surprize, when we recollect that the history of music is the
history only of sounds, of which writing is a very inadequate medium;
and that men would long employ themselves in the pleasing exercise of
cultivating music before they possessed either the ability or the
inclination to record their exertions.</p>

<p>No accurate traces, therefore, of the actual state of music, in the
earlier ages of the world, can be discerned. Our ideas on the subject
have no foundation firmer than conjecture and analogy.</p>

<p>It is probable, that among all the barbarous nations some degree of
similarity is discernable in the stile of their music. Neither will much
difference appear during the first dawnings of civilization. But in the
more advanced periods of society, where the powers of the human mind are
permitted without obstacle to exert their native activity and tendency
to invention, and are at the same time affected by the infinite variety
of circumstances and situations which before had no existence, and,
which in one case accelerate and in another retard; then that
similarity, once so distinguishable, gives place to the endless
diversity of which the subject is capable.</p>

<p>The practice of music being universal in all ages and all nations, it
would be absurd to attribute the invention of the art to any one man. It
must have suffered a regular progression, through infancy, childhood,
and youth, before it could arrive at maturity, the first attempts must
have been rude and artless; <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘pro-/bly’ at line break">probably</ins> the first flute was a reed of
the lake. Music is supposed to have taken its rise in the earliest
periods of society. “Juba,” we find soon after the creation <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘of/of’ at line break">of</ins> the
world; “was the father of all such as handle the harp and the organ;”
and it is more than probable that Moses, the most ancient of all
writers, was well acquainted with this art. The Egyptians, were the
promoters of science in the Hebrew nation, and Moses was instructed in
all the learning of the Egyptians. The sublime and animated song of
Moses on the overthrow of Pharoah in the red sea, was, we believe,
adapted to the sweet strains of music; for we are told it was sung by
Moses and the children of Isræl:&mdash;&<ins class = "correction" title

<h4><span class = "extended">FRIENDSHIP</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Friendship</span>, among
people who have not been corrupted by those artificial vices which
fatally wait upon civilized life, exists in the greatest possible purity
and constancy. The Abbé Fortis gives some curious particulars relative
to the friendships of the Morlacchi, a&nbsp;people who inhabit the
mountainous part of inland Dalmatia. Friendship is lasting among the
Morlacchi. They have even made it a kind of religious point, and tie the
sacred bond at the foot of the altar. The Sclavonian ritual contains a
particular benediction, for the solemn union of two male or two female
friends, in the presence of the congregation. The Abbé says, that he was
present at the union of two young women; who were made <i>Posestre</i>
in the church of Perussich. The satisfaction that sparkled in their eyes
when the ceremony was performed, gave a convincing proof, that delicacy
of sentiments can lodge in minds not formed, or rather not corrupted by
society, which we call civilized. The male friends thus united are
called <i>Pobratimi</i>, and the females <i>Posestreme</i>, which mean
half-brothers and half-sisters. Friendship between those of different
sexes are not bound with so much solemnity, though perhaps in more
ancient and innocent ages it was also the custom. From these consecrated
friendships among the Morlacchi, and other nations of the same origin,
it should seem that the <i>sworn brothers</i> arose, a&nbsp;denomination
frequent enough among the common people in many parts of Europe. If
discord happens to arise between two friends among the Morlacchi, it is
talked of all over the country as a scandalous novelty; and there have
been some examples of it of late years, to the great affliction of the
old Morlacchi, who attribute the depravity of their countrymen to their
intercourse with the Italians. Wine and strong liquors of which the
nation is beginning to make daily abuse, after our example, will, of
course, produce the same bad effects as among&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>Nor is the Abbé mistaken. When these simple people become more men of
the world, the romantic part of their friendships will degenerate into
that motly unintelligible thing which many people call Friendship.
Whoever, therefore, wishes to enjoy real friendship, must in the first
place expect no more from man than the frailty of his nature will admit;
and in the second place, he must not expect friendship from those, who
from their ignorance are not enabled, or from their wickedness are not
disposed, to perform acts of mutual benevolence in trying
situations.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“Good</span> evening, my
Lord,” said she with evident confusion, “have you not met Lady
Delier?”</p>

<p>“No, my Lady! I have not.”</p>

<p>“She left me some time since, and might already have returned.”</p>

<p>“Very strange! I am come to take leave, and meet you first by
accident.”</p>

<p>“Leave?” she replied with surprise, “Then you are determined to
depart to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I must.”</p>

<p>A long pause.</p>

<p>“And you are going to Ma***t?”</p>

<p>“To Ma***t, and from thence to my native country.”</p>

<p>A second pause. At length she said with emphasis and affection:
“Heaven protect you on your journey.”</p>

<p>“Dearest Countess&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, my Lord?” Amelia exclaimed, fixing her
eyes on me, “Good God, how pale you look!”</p>

<p>The emotions of my heart were dreadful; my working bosom threatened
to burst. “God knows,” I&nbsp;replied with a faltering voice, “whether I
shall see you again.”</p>

<p>“We shall certainly meet again,” said she, looking up to heaven.</p>

<p>“Merciful God! should my hopes blossom first beyond the grave.”</p>

<p>“What hopes<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has !">”?&nbsp;</ins>she exclaimed with inquisitive astonishment.</p>

<p>“And do you not divine how this separation will wound my heart?”</p>

<p>Amelia looked anxiously around, as if seeking Lady Delier; and then
fixed her eyes again doubtfully on&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>“My Lord, your words and your behaviour are mysterious to me.”</p>

<p>“Then receive their explanation kindly,” I replied, letting myself
down on one knee, and taking hold of her hand, “I&nbsp;love you.”</p>

<p>The Countess was struck dumb with surprise.&mdash;&mdash;“And this
you tell me when taking <i>leave!</i>” she <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for gasped?">lisped</ins> at length.</p>

<p>I fancied I perceived a soft pressure from her hand, and returned it
with glowing lips. She bent her taper form to raise me up, and Lady
Delier stepped suddenly between us. “What do I see?” she exclaimed,
dissembling astonishment, “a&nbsp;declaration of love?”</p>

<p>Amelia remained silent, and the Baroness repeated her question.</p>

<p>“A declaration, my Lady!” I replied, but no answer.</p>

<p>“My sweet friend,” she whispered archly in Amelia’s ear, “I hope you
will not let him despair.”</p>

<p>“I cannot conceive, my Lord,” Amelia replied, “why you make this
declaration when taking <i>leave!</i>”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">109b</span>
<p>I told her nearly the same I had said to the Baroness in the morning.
Amelia viewed me a long time with silent astonishment, and at length
replied:</p>

<p>“A misunderstanding, a misunderstanding on both sides! very strange
indeed!” she shook her head smiling.</p>

<p>“My dearest love,” the Baroness exclaimed, “look at the Duke, how he
watches every word of yours in hope of receiving an answer.”</p>

<p>Amelia seemed to hesitate what to reply; however, after a short
silence, said to me with the innate dignity of a noble, generous mind:
“My Lord, if you want to have a consort, then I must beg you to forget
me. But if you are in quest of a loving heart, then&mdash;” added she in
a low accent, and with crimsoning cheeks, “you have found&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>I don’t know what I replied, nor can I recollect what I said
afterwards; for from the moment she had pronounced the confession of her
reciprocal love, I&nbsp;thought myself transported to Paradise, and
breathed in a new and better sphere. The possession of Amelia’s heart,
ensured to me by the declaration of her own lips, had expelled from my
breast every terrestrial wish; my whole nature seemed to me exalted and
purified of all earthly dregs, and the flame which had penetrated my
frame, was a sacred fire cleared of every particle of sensuality. O!
innocent love, thou offspring of the sacred affinity of two congenial
souls, thou art perhaps the sole species of union and enjoyment, which
is capable to afford us here below a notion of the union and the
pleasure of the inhabitants of the heavenly regions. How natural
therefore, if we, particularly in the first moments of enjoyment, are
incapable to express such sentiments by words. However, my faltering
accents, my confused expressions, and my incoherent sentences, seemed
nevertheless to be as well understood by Amelia, as if she were reading
in my soul, which I could conclude from her words, and the still plainer
speaking play of her mien. Love had diffused over her countenance new
and unspeakable charms, which surrounded her with a glory that made her
appear to me a more than mortal being. And to be beloved by
her&mdash;that bliss would have overpowered me, if I had not been made
acquainted with my happiness in the morning.</p>

<p>Lady Delier, who had left us to ourselves all the time, interrupted
us at length. “Children!” said she, “do you know that it is not far from
eleven o’clock?” I&nbsp;started up as if some grisly spectre had
surprised me, because I recollected the <i>Unknown</i>, eleven o’clock
being the time when I had promised to meet him at the place of
rendezvous at a considerable distance.</p>

<p>To take leave!&mdash;without knowing whether I should ever see her
again, for I was to depart the next morn with the dawn of day. This idea
overpowered me so much, that I promised Amelia and myself to visit her
once more to-morrow before my departure. Our separation was,
nevertheless, so afflicting, the parting on both sides so difficult, and
the last adieu pronounced with quivering lips.&mdash;Alas! a&nbsp;secret
presentiment seemed to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page110" id = "page110">110</a></span>
whisper in my ear that we should meet no more. How many times did I
attempt to go and stopped again&mdash;how many times did I go and return
again to assure Amelia that I should certainly see her once
more!&mdash;Her emotions seemed, indeed, to be less vehement than mine,
however, I&nbsp;could not be deceived, and observing the secret workings
of her soul, perceived the pearly tear that started from her eye, and
the violent heaving of her bosom.</p>

<p>Lady Delier did not long remain an idle spectator, exhorting us to
dedicate the present moment to joy, and to yield to our grief to-morrow,
tearing the Countess from my arms, and wishing me a good night.</p>

<p>I stopped once more on the terrace, saw the two ladies retiring to a
grove, of beech-trees, and Amelia turned twice, beckoning to me. My
tears flowed fluently, my arms were expanded for her, the darkness of
the night concealed her from my wishful looks. I&nbsp;rushed
mechanically into the street, and arrived at the place of rendezvous
without knowing how. It was lonely spot covered with trees. The Irishman
soon joined&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>“My time is short,” he said, “and I have to tell you a great deal;
let us sit down.” So saying he led me to a stone bench beneath a
spreading oak, and we seated ourselves.</p>

<p>He seemed to observe my being violently agitated, and kept a long and
solemn silence to give me time to recover.&mdash;“I wish, my dear
Duke!”&mdash;he at length began, “that you may not expect more from this
interview than I am allowed to give. I&nbsp;must confine myself merely
to the theoretical part of that occult science to which I have promised
to initiate you after the time of probation shall be finished. However,
it is here as it is with all other sciences; the pupil of sense guesses
by the theory, what he may expect from the practical part of the
science&mdash;as a painter beholds in a sketch the picture which is to
be drawn, or as an architect sees in the plan drawn on the paper the
building which is to be constructed; be therefore satisfied with what I
dare impart to you for the present.”</p>

<p>“I do not desire you to disclose to me, more than I am able to bear
at present.”</p>

<p>The Irishman paused again, and then began thus:</p>

<p>“If our powers of perception were confined only to our senses, the
visible world would then encompass all our ideas, sentiments, wishes and
hopes. No idea of spirits, of God and of immortality would raise us
above the sphere of materiality. In order to produce and to conceive
these ideas, a&nbsp;supersensible faculty is required. This faculty
which, if closely examined, bears not the least resemblance to the rest
of our intellectual powers, is called <i>reason</i>. The idea of the
whole sensible world offers nothing to us that is not corporeal, finite,
and perishable. However the territory of reason opens to us a prospect
to a world without bounds, and of an everlasting duration; displays to
us a kingdom of spirits which is governed by <i>one</i> Infinite Spirit
after wise and sacred laws. An unknown world of which we had not the
most distant notion, of which sensation gives us not the least hint, and
for which our senses have no perception nor scale, opens to our view
when
<span class = "pagenum">110b</span>
our reason begins to unfold itself. You see, therefore what faculty of
the soul must be our guide in our present investigation, if we wish to
penetrate, by means of it, to the kingdom of spirits.”</p>

<p>“Reason!”</p>

<p>“Certainly! there is no other choice left; and therefore let us learn
to value and to use this light that illuminates the darkness in which
every object disappears from the eyes of mere sensitive men, or at most
appears very <i>obscure</i> to them. That man whose reason is
overdarkened, or discomposed by sensuality, either will deny the
existence of spirits and our relation to them, or attribute to them the
contradictory shape which his disordered imagination has hatched out,
like the blind-born, who denies the existence of colours as ridiculous
and absurd, or if he believes the unanimous testimony of those that see,
imagines colours to bear some resemblance to sounds. Unbelief and
superstition afford us numberless instances of people of that
description. Only the more impartial have always maintained that one
ought not to judge precipitately of these objects, and only the wisest
of mankind have been able to form a just judgment of them.”</p>

<p>“O Hiermanfor! introduce me to the circle of the latter. I have
already in the different periods of my life adhered to all the other
parties. In the days of my earlier youth I believed in apparitions, like
the most ignorant of the lowest class. In a more advanced period of life
I fancied I was convinced of the impossibility of apparitions, and ever
since I got acquainted with you, I&nbsp;have been wavering between
unbelief and superstition. It was but lately that I resolved to postpone
my judgment on these subjects, till I should be better convinced, and
this conviction I expect of you.”</p>

<p>Soul of the universe! but for thee, the vast ocean were but a
motionless and frozen lump: the earth a barren heap of sand and mud; the
atmosphere a gloomy void. Thou cherishedst the elements with thy
vivifying and genial warmth; the air became fluid and insinuating, the
waters moist and yielding, the earth animated and fruitful. Every thing
took life; every thing wore the face of beauty. The elements, those
universal parents which till then had lain fast locked in the chill arms
of rest, now moved into alliance. The fire slid into the bosom of the
waters: the waters parting into vapour, flew aloft, and spread
themselves through the air: from the air, the earth received into her
womb the precious rudiments of fertility: then began she to bring forth
the unceasing fruits of that ever-renewing love, first kindled by thy
rays.</p>

(Continued from <a href = "#page107">page 107</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I returned</span> home in a
state of desperation. The odious names which Pulaski had lavished on me,
returned unceasingly to my reflection. The interests of Poland, and
those of M. de <span class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;</span>, appeared
to be so intimately connected together, that I did not perceive in what
manner I could betray my fellow-citizens by serving my friend; in the
mean time I was obliged either to abandon or renounce Lodoiska for ever.
What was I to resolve? what part should I take? I&nbsp;passed the whole
night in a state of the most cruel uncertainty; and when the day
appeared, I&nbsp;went towards Pulaski’s house, without yet having come
to any determination.</p>

<p>The only domestic who remained there informed me, that his lord had
departed at the beginning of the night, with his daughter, after having
first dismissed all his people. Think of my despair on hearing this
news. I&nbsp;asked to what part Pulaski had retired. But my question was
in vain, he informed me that he was certainly ignorant of the place of
his destination.</p>

<p>“All that I can tell you,” says he, “is that you had scarce gone away
yesterday evening, when we heard a great noise in the apartment of his
daughter. Still terrified at the scene which had taken place between
you, I&nbsp;approached the door, and listened. Lodoiska wept: her
furious father overwhelmed her with injuries, bestowed his malediction
upon her, and I myself heard him exclaim: ‘To love a traitor, is to be
one! Ungrateful wretch! I&nbsp;shall conduct you to a place of safety,
where you shall henceforth be at a distance from seduction<ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">.’”</ins></p>

<p>Could I any longer doubt the extent of my misery? I instantly called
for Boleslas, one of the most faithful of my domestics: I&nbsp;ordered
him to place trusty spies about the palace of Pulaski, who should bring
an account of every thing that passed there; and commanded that if the
count returned to the capital before me, he should follow him wherever
he went. Having given these instructions, and not yet despairing of
still finding the family at one of their seats in the neighbourhood of
the metropolis, I&nbsp;myself set out in pursuit of my mistress.</p>

<p>I accordingly searched through all the domains of Pulaski, and asked
concerning Lodoiska of all the passengers whom I met, but without
success. After having spent eight days in fruitless enquiry,
I&nbsp;resolved to return to Warsaw, and I was not a little astonished,
on my arrival, to find a Russian army encamped on the banks of the
Vistula, almost under the very walls of that city.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">114b</span>
<p>It was night when I entered the capital: the palaces of the grandees
were all illuminated, an immense multitude filled the streets;
I&nbsp;heard the songs of joy; I&nbsp;beheld wine flowing in rivulets in
the public squares: every thing announced to me that Poland had a
king.</p>

<p>Boleslas, who expected me with impatience, informed me that Pulaski
had returned alone on the second day after my departure; and that he had
not stirred from his own palace but to repair to the diet, where, in
spite of his efforts, the ascendancy of Russia became every day more
manifest. “During the last assembly held this very morning,” adds he,
“M. de <span class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;</span> united almost all
the suffrages in his favour, and was about to be declared king, when
Pulaski pronounced the fatal <i>Veto</i>: at that instant twenty sabres
were brandished in the air. The fierce palatine of
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, whom the count had insulted in the former
assembly, was the first to rush forwards, and gave him a terrible wound
on the head. Zaremba, and some others, flew to the defence of their
friend; but all their efforts would have been unable to have saved him,
if M. de <span class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span> had
not ranged himself on their side, exclaiming at the same time, that he
would sacrifice, with his own hand, the first person who dared to
approach him. On this the assailants retired. In the mean time Pulaski,
fainting with the loss of blood, was carried off the field in a state of
insensibility. Zaremba departed also, swearing to avenge his friend.
Having thus become master of the deliberations, the numerous partisans
of M. de <span class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>,
instantly proclaimed him sovereign.</p>

<p>“Pulaski, who had been carried to his palace, was soon restored to
life; and the surgeons who attended him, declared that his wounds,
although dangerous, were not mortal. In that state, although languishing
under the most cruel torments, contrary to the advice of all his
friends, he ordered himself to be lifted into his carriage, and before
noon he left Warsaw, accompanied by Mazeppa and a few
male-contents.”</p>

<p>It was scarcely possible to have announced worse news to me. My
friend was upon the throne, but my reconciliation with Pulaski appeared
henceforth impossible, and in all appearance Lodoiska was lost for ever.
I&nbsp;knew her father so well as to be under apprehensions lest he
should proceed to extremities with his daughter. I&nbsp;was affrighted
at the present, I&nbsp;durst not look forwards towards the future; and
my heart was so devoured with chagrin, that I did not go out, even to
felicitate the new king.</p>

<p>One of my people, whom Boleslas dispatched after Pulaski, returned at
the end of the fourth day: he had followed him fifteen leagues from the
capital; when, about that distance, Zaremba, who perceived a stranger at
a little distance from the carriage, began to conceive suspicions. As
they proceeded, four of his followers, who had concealed themselves
behind the ruins of an old house, surprised my courier, and conducted
him to Pulaski. He, with a pistol in his hand, forced him to acknowledge
to whom he belonged. “I&nbsp;shall send you back to Lovzinski,”
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page115" id = "page115">115</a></span>
said the fierce republican, “on purpose to announce from me, that he
shall not escape my just vengeance.” At these words they blindfolded my
servant, who could not tell where they had carried him. At the end of
four-and-twenty hours they resumed, and tying a handkerchief once more
about his eyes they put him into a carriage, which having stopped at
length, after a journey of several hours, he was ordered to descend.
Scarce had he put his foot upon the ground but his guards departed at a
full gallop; on which he removed the bandage, and found himself
precisely on the same spot as that on which he had been first
arrested.</p>

<p>This intelligence filled me with uneasiness; the menaces of Pulaski
terrified me, much less on my own account than on Lodoiska’s, who
remained in his power: in the midst of his fury he might sacrifice her
life! I&nbsp;resolved therefore to expose myself to every species of
danger, on purpose to discover the retreat of the father, and the prison
of his only child.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day, after informing my sisters of my design,
I&nbsp;left the capital: Boleslas alone accompanied me, and I passed for
his brother. We wandered over all Poland, and I then perceived that the
fears of Pulaski were but too well justified by the event. Under
pretence of obliging the inhabitants to take the oath of fidelity to the
new King, the Russians, scattered about in the provinces, desolated the
country, and committed a multitude of exactions in the cities.</p>

<p>After having spent three months in vain enquiries, despairing of
being able to find Lodoiska, touched with the most lively grief for the
fate of my country, and weeping at one and the same time for her
misfortunes and my own, I&nbsp;was about to return to Warsaw, to inform
the new king of the excesses committed by those foreigners in his
states, when an adventure that at first seemed to be very inauspicious,
forced me to a very different resolution.</p>

<p>The Turks having declared war against Russia, the Tartars of Budziac
and the Crimea made frequent incursions into Volhynia, where I then was.
Four of those robbers attacked us one afternoon, as we were leaving a
wood near Ostropol. I&nbsp;had imprudently neglected to load my pistols;
but I made use of my sabre with so much address and good luck, that in a
short time, two of them fell covered with wounds. Boleslas encountered
the third: the fourth attacked me with great fury; he gave me a slight
cut upon the leg, but received a terrible stroke in return, that
dismounted him from his horse, and felled him to the ground. Boleslas at
the same moment perceived himself disencumbered from his enemy, who, at
the noise made by his comrade’s fall, took to flight. He whom I had just
vanquished, then addressed me in very bad Polish, and said:
“a&nbsp;brave man like you ought to be generous. I&nbsp;beg my life of
you; instead of putting me to death, succour me, relieve me, bind up my
wounds, and assist me to arise.”</p>

<p>He demanded quarter with an air so noble, that I did not hesitate for
a moment. I&nbsp;accordingly descend from my horse, and Boleslas and
myself having helped him to
<span class = "pagenum">115b</span>
arise, we dressed his wounds. “You behave well!” says the Tartar to me;
“you behave well!” As he spoke we beheld a cloud of dust, and in a
moment after more than three hundred Tartars rushed upon us at full
speed. “Be not afraid, dread nothing,” says he whom I had spared;
“I&nbsp;am chief of this troop.” Accordingly, by means of a sign, he
stops his followers, who were on the point of massacring us; and
speaking to them in their own language, which I was unable to
comprehend, they instantly open their ranks on purpose to permit us to
pass.</p>

<p>“Brave man,” exclaims their captain, addressing himself to me once
more, “had I not reason to say that you behaved well? You left me my
life, and I now save yours; it is sometimes right to spare an enemy, and
even a robber! Hear me, my friend: in attacking you, I&nbsp;followed my
profession, and you did your duty in conquering me. I&nbsp;pardon you,
you have already pardoned me; let us therefore embrace<ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins>&mdash;He then adds:
“The day is wasting, and I would not advise you to travel in these
cantons during the present night. My people are about to repair each to
his respective post, and I cannot answer for their discretion. You
perceive a castle on a rising ground, towards the right: it belongs to a
certain Pole of the name of Dourlinski, for whom we have a high esteem,
because he is very rich. Go, demand an asylum from him; tell him that
you have wounded Titsikan, and that Titsikan pursues you. He is
acquainted with my name: I&nbsp;have already made him pass many an
uneasy night. As to the rest, you may rely on it, that while you remain

<p>Fouquet, intendant of the finances to Lewis the Fourteenth, after
living in the greatest splendor, enjoying the unlimited favour and
confidence of his master, and seeing his levees crowded by the first
nobles in the land, fell into disgrace, and was sent to the Bastile. He
experienced the common fate of all favourites in disgrace; forsaken by
his friends, and persecuted by his foes, the courtiers in general viewed
his ruin with pleasure, and charitably resolved to complete his
destruction. The envious and the disappointed had found means to
prejudice his sovereign against him, and his displeasure was the signal
of hatred and persecution to the fawning crew that surrounded his
throne. Adulation is coeval with monarchy; and no king probably ever
deserved implicit obedience from his subjects more than Lewis the
Fourteenth<a class = "plain" name = "tag116a" id = "tag116a" href =
"#note116a">*</a>, on whom nature had conferred every quality that could
excite awe, or command respect; the majesty of his person seemed one of
his first claims to sovereignty. It has been remarked, that but very few
of those who were so unfortunate to incur the displeasure of this
prince, could survive the loss of his favour<a class = "tag" name =
"tag116b" id = "tag116b" href = "#note116b">†</a>. Fouquet is one of the
few. He was well aware, however, of the extreme danger to which he was
exposed; and among an infinity of motives for serious apprehension, the
intendant regarded the examination of his papers as one of the most
certain causes of his ruin. This consideration greatly encreased the
anxiety occasioned by his confinement; if he could but have destroyed
those unfortunate papers previous to his detention, he should not have
so much dreaded the machinations of his enemies, however ingeniously
formed, or inveterately pursued.</p>

<p>In the midst of these alarms for his situation, he received the
dreadful news that Pélisson, his secretary, and his friend, had openly
declared himself his accuser, and was soon to be confronted with him.
Shocked at the intelligence, his courage forsook him, and he gave way to
despair.</p>

<p>This action of Pélisson’s soon made a noise in the world, and excited
the most lively sensations of resentment in the minds of the public, who
so seldom interest themselves in the fate of the unfortunate. Every body
exclaimed that he was the most base and most criminal of
<span class = "pagenum">116b</span>
mankind! Loaded with the benefactions of his master, honoured with his
particular confidence,&mdash;his friend, in short&mdash;he stands
forward in the infamous light of a public informer, and is about to stab
him to the heart.</p>

<p>Pélisson, could not be ignorant of these reports to his prejudice,
which encreased every day; at length they attained to such a height,
that some worthy members of society took the resolution publicly to
reproach him with the baseness of his conduct, wherever they met him.
The secretary, though now an object of contempt, preserved his
tranquility, and appeared wholly indifferent to every thing that was
said to him. The few friends who still remained true to the interests of
the unfortunate minister, went to Pélisson’s house, and by alternate
threats, entreaties, and supplications, endeavoured to deter him from
his purpose, but in vain; he remained firm, and persisted in his
resolution of speaking the truth, and of accusing Fouquet to his face.
It must be observed that the prisoner, during this time, was invisible
to every one but his judges, who were his greatest enemies, and many of
whom, in violation of every principle of justice, had openly declared
their intention of finding him guilty.</p>

<p>At length the day arrived on which Pélisson was to prefer his
accusation, and incur the atrocious sin of ingratitude. The doors of the
Bastile are opened to him: he is confronted with his master, who
exclaims, “Ah Pélisson, is it you? Are you my enemy, too?&mdash;Alas!
I&nbsp;mistook you for my friend!”&mdash;The secretary, far from being
disconcerted at this exclamation, began to fulfil the task he had
undertaken, with all the impudence of the most hardened calumniator; he
taxed Fouquet with crimes which were totally destitute of foundation,
and which he hastened to contradict, with the manly firmness of
conscious innocence. “That is not true,” said he, interrupting Pélisson,
“you are an impostor, a&nbsp;detestable lyar! Can you advance falsehoods
thus gross, and not blush with shame?”&mdash;“Oh,” replied Pélisson,
whose countenance betrayed the most violent indignation, “you would not
dare to contradict me, with so much assurance, if you did not know that
your papers were burnt.”</p>

<p>These last words flashed conviction on the mind of Fouquet, who
immediately perceived the wonderful address of Pélisson, and the
generosity of his soul. He perceived that his secretary, firm and
unshaken in his friendship, had burned his papers, and had conceived the
design&mdash;the only one that could be possibly adopted&mdash;of
becoming the accuser, in order to gain admittance to his inaccessible
prison, that he might make him acquainted with the important service he
had rendered him. The intendant, ashamed of his unjust suspicions, and
anxious to make amends for them, cast a look on Pélisson, which gave him
to understand that he had perfectly understood him, and was penetrated
with the most lively sensations of gratitude for his conduct.</p>

<p>The secretary, feeling the complete satisfaction at the success of
his project, still continued to expose himself to the scorn and
indignation of the public. Considered as the basest of mankind, he
experienced every species of insult; while conscious integrity insured
to him that serenity of soul, which was regarded as the hardened
effrontery of a mind wholly callous to shame.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page117" id = "page117">117</a></span>
<p>It was not till some time after that the truth came to be known. The
scene then changed. Pélisson became the object of general admiration,
and of enthusiastic esteem, that bordered on veneration; but he still
preserved the same serenity of mind, and displayed the same indifference
to merited praise, as he had before shewn to unmerited censure. Whenever
his friends expatiated on his unshaken firmness, and extraordinary
heroism, the worthy stoic replied&mdash;“That man must appear of little
consequence in his own eyes, whose moral existence depends merely on the
opinion of others! It is our place to fix a just value on ourselves
before others attempt to appreciate us. I&nbsp;did but fulfil my duty in
serving a man to whom I did not chuse to be an impotent or useless
friend: the title of friend imposes on those who bear it essential
obligations, which I have endeavoured to discharge; I&nbsp;have given
more than my life: I&nbsp;have suffered myself to be polluted by the
imputation of vice and dishonour; because it was the only means of
serving the friend I loved. What made me amends for the mean opinion
which the public entertained of me?&mdash;The good opinion I entertained
of myself. That paid me amply for the effects of prejudice which was
founded in injustice. Virtue is but mental fortitude; and I exerted the
whole of mine, to be able to brave the opinion of all mankind. You now
see, there are occasions which require a man to raise himself above that
<i>solemn</i> judgment to which every human being must generally submit.
You must permit me, however, to give you one piece of advice. Another
time be less prompt to decide on the merits of a man who enjoys some
reputation for probity; and be assured, that he can never be on a sudden
converted into the vilest of rogues. The friend of Fouquet could not act
in a manner so contrary to his natural disposition.”</p>

<p>Philosophy&mdash;adds the relator of this anecdote&mdash;will have
attained to its highest degree of perfection, when it shall have
enforced the conviction. That virtue is infinitely superior to talents.
By virtue alone can the duties we owe to society, and to ourselves, be
properly discharged.</p>

The reader must recollect that these are the sentiments of a Frenchman,
before the late revolution! The character of Lewis the Fourteenth, as a
promoter of the arts and sciences, is certainly respectable&mdash;but as
a monarch&mdash;who should prefer the welfare and felicity of his
subjects to the gratification of his own ambitious views&mdash;it is
<span class = "smallroman">DETESTABLE</span>!</p>

It is certain that the famous painter, Le Brun, having lost the favour
of Lewis the Fourteenth, who had been particularly kind to him, died
thro’ despair, at the Gobelins. The death of Racine, the celebrated
dramatic poet, which happened not long after the production of Athalia,
one of his best pieces, was owing to the same cause; and the haughty
Louvois only survived his disgrace three days.</p>

will be no easy task to me to guide you. I&nbsp;shall be obliged to
avoid all emblematic language, in order to convey to your mind these
supersensible notions in their natural purity, and it will be necessary
that you should know how to apply the abstractest and purest notions,
although they should contradict your present manner of perception.”</p>

<p>“I shall at least not be wanting in attention and good-will.”</p>

<p>“First of all it will be necessary to agree in the notion of what is
called <i>spirit</i>. The best method of fixing that notion will be to
examine what the word spirit means according to the general rules of
language. If one man says, man consists of body and spirit, by the
former a corporeal, and by the latter an incorporeal being is
understood. We have, therefore, a&nbsp;common point from which we can
proceed in our investigation. <i>Spirit</i> is opposite to body. In this
point we agree according to the most general meaning and use of the
word.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Let us see what follows thence! Every <i>body</i> is a compounded,
extended, impenetrable being, subject to the laws of motion,
consequently, every <i>spirit</i> is a simple, unextended and penetrable
being, not subject to the laws of motion.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so!”</p>

<p>“Bodies are extended, that is they occupy a <i>room</i>, and the
proportion which one body bears to the other in point of <i>room</i>,
constitutes its <i>place</i>; spirits are not extended, and consequently
exist in no <i>room</i>, and in no <i>place</i>.”</p>

<p>“How am I to understand this?”</p>

<p>“Just as I have said.&mdash;But let me elucidate my argument. Why
cannot two bodies exist at the same time, in the same space? Because
they exclude each other on account of their extension and
impenetrability. Two bodies must, of course, occupy two different
places, if existing at the same time; that is, every individual body
must occupy its own individual place. And why must every body occupy its
<i>own</i> place?”</p>

<p>“Because of its expansion and impenetrability.”</p>

<p>“Very well! But these two qualities cannot appertain to a spirit,
and, consequently, a&nbsp;spirit can occupy no place.”</p>

<p>“This seems really to follow.”</p>

<p>“This argument can also be stated thus: a spirit has, as a simple
being, neither a right nor left, neither a front nor a back side, and
consequently can have no relation from <i>no side</i> to any thing that
occupies a space. The conclusion is very palpable.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page118" id = "page118">118</a></span>
<p>“Then a spirit could occupy no room in the whole material world?”</p>

<p>“Would you perhaps assign to spirits a place in the immaterial world?
How could you imagine, without contradiction, that space or place can
exist in <i>such</i> a world? If one spirit does not occupy a room, then
all spirits together can occupy none, how could therefore any proportion
exist among them with relation to space or place?”</p>

<p>“I comprehend and do not comprehend you. You want to convince me of
the possibility of apparitions of spirits, and deny the existence of
spirits; for if they do occupy no place either in the visible or
invisible world, <i>where</i> else can they exist?”</p>

<p>“How sensitive and confused your ideas are! Don’t you perceive that
your question is equal to this: <i>in which place</i> do spirits exist?
and that, of course, you premise in your question what I have just
clearly proved to be absurd. Do you not comprehend that <i>room</i> and
<i>place</i> are nothing else but <i>external</i> qualities, only
relations of <i>material</i> things? and do you believe that the
existence of any being depends merely on external qualities and material
relations?”</p>

<p>“Have patience with me!”</p>

<p>“I have; for I am well aware how difficult it is to abstract from
material ideas; however, since they cannot be applicable to spirits we
must renounce them, else we cannot pass over the bounds of the material
world.”</p>

<p>“I intreat you, Hiermanfor, to go on!”</p>

<p>“From our investigation we have learnt, as yet, nothing farther than
what a spirit is <i>not</i>, and what attributes <i>cannot</i> be
ascribed to it. We now must endeavour to state what <i>real</i>
qualities constitute the nature of spirits. One of them we have already
touched upon; I&nbsp;mean, independence of the laws of physical nature,
or <i>arbitrary choice</i>. A second quality presses upon us, namely the
<i>faculty of perception</i>, which our soul is endowed with like all
other spirits. And now we are enabled to form a notion of spirits,
which, however imperfect it be, yet is determined: a&nbsp;spirit is a
simple being, endowed with <i>arbitrary choice</i>, and the <i>faculty
of perception</i>. Don’t you think that this definition answers the
common manner of speaking.”</p>

<p>“An additional proof of its fitness.”</p>

<p>“In the same manner in which the body evinces its existence, by the
material effect it produces in the room, the spirit likewise proves its
existence by the manifestation of its faculty of perception and of free
will. However evident and generally received this proposition is, yet it
is misapplied very frequently; for it is, according to my premises,
absolutely false, and nothing else but a kind of optic illusion, if we
imagine our soul to be inclosed in the human body, nay even in some
particular place of it. This illusion may be opposed by another: there
are diversions of thought, in which the thinking principle leaves our
body so entirely, that only the animal powers are active in the latter,
and on the return of our awakening self-consciousness, the soul seems to
return from far distant regions. However,
<span class = "pagenum">118b</span>
this too is mere illusion. We can say nothing farther of the union which
subsists between our soul and body, than that our soul is sensible of
the existence of a corporeal organ, the mutations of which harmonise
exactly with her ideas and resolutions; however, as you never will
suppose that your spirit is inclosed by the walls of Amelia’s distant
habitation, where your whole soul, with all her sentiments and ideas,
is, as it were, translated to; so your spirit can also not be supposed
to be inclosed in your body, which seems to be its common residence. No,
no, my Lord, that cannot be! the bonds of space can never fetter an
immaterial being to a material one.”</p>

<p>“This is indeed the natural conclusion which flows from your
premises; but by <i>what</i> bonds should then the communion between
body and soul be preserved?”</p>

<p>“Your question refers to a fact, the answer to it, consequently,
belongs to the practical part of this philosophy. Yet,” added the
Irishman after some reflections, “I&nbsp;can give you a hint upon that
head, which will throw some light upon it: Every substance, consequently
the body too, must possess an internal activity, that is the invisible
cause of its external actions, which are visible in the space. This
internal principle of the body, acts upon the spirit in the same manner
in which the spirit acts upon this principle. Soul and body,
consequently, cannot act upon each other <i>immediately</i>, but only by
means of this principle. As all material beings, concretively taken,
compose a great totum, which is called the physical world, so the
concrete of all immaterial beings composes what we call the immaterial
world. It follows from the antecedent, that the order, regularity, and
union which are seen in the former world, are entirely different from
the order, regularity, and union which prevails in the latter world. All
material beings are subject to the sceptre of stern necessity, and kept
in order by physical laws; the rank which these beings maintain towards
one another, is founded either on innate qualities, or such as have been
attributed to them by general agreement; and they are nearer each other,
or more distant from one another, according to their relations
constituted by space and time. How different is this in the material
world! rational beings, endowed with free will, are subject to no other
laws but to those of morality; the prerogatives and degrees which
subsist among them, depend on the different degrees of their wisdom and
virtue, and according to the similarity or difference of their manner of
thinking, and of their sentiments, they are nearer each other, or more
distant from one another; that is, they harmonize, or disharmonize. Man
belongs, by virtue of his body and soul, to both of these worlds, and,
consequently, is connected with the material and immaterial world. It
may therefore happen, that the same person who acts an important part on
earth, in virtue of his physical or political situation, occupies at the
same time the lowest degree among the super-terrestrial beings; that the
soul of a body whose beauty charms every eye here below, is an
indifferent, or a contemptible object in the spiritual world; that the
soul
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page119" id = "page119">119</a></span>
of an inhabitant of Saturn, and that of an inhabitant of the earth, with
regard to their spiritual communion, are oftentimes, nearer neighbours
than the souls of those whose abode is beneath the same roof.”</p>

<h4 class = "six">REFLECTIONS ON THE HARMONY OF SENSIBILITY AND
REASON.</h4>

<p class = "center smallest">SINCERITY.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A little</span> judgment,
with less sensibility, makes a man cunning; a&nbsp;little more feeling,
with even less reason, would make him sincere.</p>

<p>Some have no more knowledge of humanity, than just serves them to put
on an appearance of it, to answer their own base and selfish
purposes.</p>

<p>He who prefers cunning to sincerity, is insensible to the disgrace
and suspicion which attend craft and deceit, and the social satisfaction
which the generous mind finds in honesty and plain-dealing.</p>

<p>Men who know not the pleasures of sincerity, and who traffic in
deceit, barter an image of kindness for a shadow of joy, and are
deceived more than they deceive.</p>

<p class = "center smallest">PASSION.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Let</span> us suppose an end of Passion,
there must be an end of reasoning. Passion alone can correct Passion.
Thus we forego a present pleasure, in hopes that we shall afterwards
enjoy a greater pleasure, or of longer duration: or suffer a present
pain, to escape a greater; and this is called an act of the judgment. He
who gives way to the dictates of present passion, without consulting
experience, listens to a partial evidence, and must of course determine
wrongfully.</p>

<p>Some, in order to pay a false compliment to sentimental pleasures,
attempt altogether to depreciate the pleasures of sense: with as little
justice, though with like plausibility, have men endeavoured to decry
the natural passions and affections as inconsistent with human felicity.
Not from our natural desires and passions do we suffer misery; for,
without these, what pleasure can we be supposed to enjoy? But from false
desires, or diseased appetites, acting without the aid of experience and
understanding.</p>

<p>He who commits an action which debases him in his own mind, besides
its other evil consequences, lays up a
<span class = "pagenum">121b</span>
store of future misery, which will haunt him as long as the memory of
the deed remains.</p>

<p>Along with the present effects of any action, in order to judge of it
aright, we must put in the balance also its future consequences, and
consider, on one side, the satisfaction and honour; on the other, the
evil and disgrace that may attend&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Magnanimity exercises itself in contempt of labours and pains, in
order to avoid greater pains, or overtake greater pleasures.</p>

<p class = "center smallest">TEMPERANCE.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> great rule of sensual pleasures
is to use them so as they may not destroy themselves, or be divorced
from the pleasures of sentiment; but rather as they are assisted by, and
mutually assisting to, the more refined and exalted sympathy of rational
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Men ever refine the meaning of the word pleasure to what pleases
themselves: gluttons imagine, that by pleasure is meant gluttony. The
only true epicures are such as enjoy the pleasures of temperance. Small
pleasures seem great to such as know no greater. The virtuous man is he
who has sense enough to enjoy the greatest pleasure.</p>

<p>Superfluity and parade among the vulgar-rich pass for elegance and
greatness. To the man of true taste, temperance is luxury, and
simplicity grandeur.</p>

<p>Whatever pleasures are immediately derived from the senses, persons
of fine internal feelings enjoy besides their other pleasures; while
such as place their chief happiness in the former, can have no true
taste for the delicious sensations of the soul.</p>

<p>They who divide profit and honesty, mistake the nature of the one or
the other. We must make a difference between appearances and truths: the
really profitable and the good are the same.</p>

<p>False appearances of profit are the greatest enemies to true
interest. Future sorrows present themselves in the disguise of present
pleasures, and short-sighted folly eagerly embraces the deceit.</p>

<i>THE BARON DE LOVZINSKI.</i></h4>

<p class = "hanging smaller">
With a relation of the most remarkable occurrences in the life of the
celebrated <span class = "smallcaps">Count Pulaski</span>, well known as
the champion of American Liberty, and who bravely fell in its defence
before Savannah, 1779.</p>

<p class = "center smaller">
(Continued from page <ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing">115.</ins>)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">We</span> soon arrived at
the ditch of the castle; the servants of Dourlinski demanded who we
were; I&nbsp;answered that we were come from Pulaski, and wished to
speak to their lord, and that we had been attacked by robbers, who were
still in pursuit of us. The drawbridge was accordingly let down; and
having entered, we were informed that at present we could not see
Dourlinski, but that on the next day at ten o’clock he would give us
audience. They then demanded our arms, which we delivered up without any
difficulty, and Boleslas soon after took an opportunity of looking at my
wound, which was found to be but superficial.</p>

<p>In a short time a frugal repast was served up for us in the kitchen.
We were afterwards conducted to a lower chamber, where two beds were
prepared for us. The domestics then left us without any light, and
immediately locked the door of the apartment.</p>

<p>I could not close my eyes during the whole night. Titsikan had given
me but a slight wound, but that which my heart had received was so very
deep! At day break, I&nbsp;became impatient in my prison, and wished to
open the shutters, but they were nailed up. I&nbsp;attacked them,
however, so vigorously, that the fastenings gave way, and I beheld a
very fine park. The window being low, I&nbsp;cleared it at a leap, and
in a single instant found myself in the gardens of the Polish
chieftain.</p>

<p>After having walked about for a few minutes, I sat down on a stone
bench, which was placed at the foot of a tower, whose ancient
architecture I had been some time considering. I&nbsp;remained for a few
seconds enveloped in reflection, when a tile fell at my feet.
I&nbsp;thought that it had dropped from the roof of this old building;
and, to avoid the effects of a similar accident, I&nbsp;went and placed
myself at the other end of the seat. A&nbsp;few moments after,
a&nbsp;second tile fell by my side. The circumstance appeared
surprising: I&nbsp;arose with some degree of inquietude, and attentively
examined the tower. I&nbsp;perceived at about twenty-five or thirty feet
from the ground, a&nbsp;narrow opening. On this I picked up the tiles
which had been thrown at me, and on the first I discovered the following
words, written with a bit of plaister;</p>

<p class = "inset">
“<span class = "smallcaps">LOVZINSKI, is it you! Do you still
live!</span>”</p>

<p>And on the second these:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“<span class = "smallcaps">Deliver me! save Lodoiska.</span>”</p>

<p>It is impossible to conceive how many different sentiments occupied
my mind at one and the same time: my astonishment, my joy, my grief, my
embarrassment, cannot be expressed. I&nbsp;examined
<span class = "pagenum">122b</span>
once more the prison of Lodoiska, and plotted in my own mind how I could
procure her liberty. She at length threw down another tile, and I read
as follows:</p>

<p>“At midnight, bring me paper, ink, and pens; and to-morrow, an hour
after sun-rise, come and receive a
letter.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Begone.”&mdash;</p>

<p>Having returned towards <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘by’">my</ins> chamber, I called to Boleslas, who assisted me in
re-entering through the window. I&nbsp;then informed my faithful
servant, of the unexpected accident that had put an end to my
wanderings, and redoubled my inquietude.</p>

<p>How could I penetrate into this tower? How could we procure arms? By
what means were we to deliver Lodoiska from captivity! How could we
carry her off under the eye of Dourlinski, in the midst of his people,
from a fortified castle? and supposing that so many obstacles were not
unsurmountable, could I attempt such an enterprize during the short
delay prescribed by Titsikan?</p>

<p>Did not the Tartar enjoin me to stay with Dourlinski three days, but
not to remain longer than eight?</p>

<p>Would it not be to expose ourselves to the attacks of the enemy, to
leave this castle before the third, or after the expiration of the
eighth day? Should I release my dear Lodoiska from a prison, on purpose
to deliver her into the hands of robbers, to be forever separated from
her either by slavery or death? This would be a horrible idea!</p>

<p>But wherefore was she confined in such a frightful prison? The letter
which she had promised would doubtless instruct me: It was therefore
necessary to procure paper, pen and ink. I&nbsp;accordingly charged
Boleslas with this employment, and began to prepare myself for acting
the delicate part of an emissary of Pulaski in the presence of
Dourlinski.</p>

<p>It was broad day-light when they came to set us at liberty, and
inform us, that Dourlinski was at leisure and wished to see us. We
accordingly presented ourselves before him with great confidence; and we
were introduced to a man of about sixty years of age, whose reception
was blunt, and whose manners were repulsive. He demanded who we were.
“My brother and myself,” replied I, “belong to Count Pulaski. My master
has entrusted me with a secret commission to you. My brother accompanies
me on another account. Before I explain, I&nbsp;must be in private, for
I am charged not to speak but to you alone.”</p>

<p>“It is very well,” replies Dourlinski: “your brother may retire, and
you also,” addressing himself to his servants; “begone! As to him
(pointing to a person who was his confident), he must remain, and you
may speak any thing before him.”</p>

<p>“Pulaski has sent me.”&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;“I see very well
that he has sent you,” says the palatine, interrupting
me&mdash;&mdash;“to demand of you&mdash;”
“What?”&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;“news of his daughter.”&mdash;“News
of his daughter! Did Pulaski say so?”&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;“Yes my
lord, he said that his daughter
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page123" id = "page123">123</a></span>
was here.”<span class = "locked">---</span>I perceived that Dourlinski
instantly grew pale; he then looked towards his confident, and surveyed
me for some time in silence.</p>

<p>“You astonish me,” rejoins he at length. “In confiding a secret of
this importance to you, it necessarily follows that your master must
have been very imprudent.”</p>

<p>“No more than you, my lord, for have not you also a confident?
Grandees would be much to be pitied if they could not rely upon any of
their domestics. Pulaski has charged me to inform you, that Lovsinski
has already searched through a great part of Poland, and that he will
undoubtedly visit these cantons.”</p>

<p>“If he dares to come here,” replies he with great vivacity,
“I&nbsp;will provide a lodging for him, which he shall inhabit for some
time. Do you know this Lovsinski?”</p>

<p>“I have seen him at my master’s house in Warsaw.”&mdash;“They say he
is handsome?”</p>

<p>“He is well made, and about my size.”</p>

<p>“His person?---is prepossessing; it
is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He is a wretch,” adds he, interrupting me in a great
passion&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;“O that he were but to fall into my
hands!”</p>

<p>“My lord, they say that he is brave---”</p>

<p>“He! I will wager any sum of money that he is only calculated to
seduce women!<span class = "locked">---</span>O that he would but fall
into my hands!” Then, assuming a less ferocious tone, he continued thus.
“It is a long time since Pulaski wrote to me<span class =
"locked">---</span>where is he at present?”</p>

<p>“My lord, I have precise orders not to answer that question: all that
I dare to say is, that he has the strongest reasons for neither
discovering the place of his retreat, nor writing to any person, and
that he will soon come and explain them to you in person.”</p>

<p>Dourlinski appeared exceedingly astonished at this information;
I&nbsp;could discover some symptoms of fear in his countenance. At
length, looking at his confident, who seemed equally embarrassed with
himself, he proceeded: “You say that Pulaski will come here soon?”<span
class = "locked">---</span>“Yes, my lord, in about a fortnight, or a
little later.” On this he again turned to his attendant; but in a short
time affecting as much calmness as he had before discovered
embarrassment; “Return to your master<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has .">”,&nbsp;</ins>added he; “I&nbsp;am sorry to have nothing
but bad news to communicate to him&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;tell him
that Lodoiska is no longer here.” I&nbsp;myself became surprised in my
turn at this information. “What! my lord,
Lodoiska&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is not longer here, I tell you!&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To oblige
Pulaski, whom I esteem, I&nbsp;undertook, although with great
repugnance, the talk of confining his daughter in my castle: nobody but
myself and he (pointing to his confident) knew that she was here. It is
about a month since we went, as usual, to carry her provisions for the
day, but there was nobody in the apartment. I&nbsp;am ignorant how it
happened; but what I know well is, that she has escaped, for I have
heard nothing of her since.<span class = "locked">---</span>She must
undoubtedly have gone to join Lovsinski
<span class = "pagenum">123b</span>
at Warsaw, if perchance the Tartars have not intercepted her in her
journey.”</p>

<p>My astonishment on this became extreme. How could I reconcile that
which I had seen in the garden, with that which Dourlinski now told me?
There was some mystery in this business, which I became exceedingly
impatient to be acquainted with: I&nbsp;was however extremely careful
not to exhibit any appearance of doubt. “My lord,” said I, “this is bad
news for my master!”&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;“Undoubtedly, but it is
not my fault.”</p>

<p>“My lord, I have a favour to ask of you.”</p>

<p>“Let me hear it.”&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;“The Tartars are ravaging the
neighbourhood of your castle&mdash;they attacked
us&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;we escaped as it were by a miracle. Will you
permit my brother and myself to remain here only for the space of two
days?”</p>

<p>“For two days only I give my consent.”</p>

<p>“Where do they lodge?” says he to his attendant. “<ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘in’">In</ins> an apartment below
ground,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Which overlooks my gardens?” rejoins Dourlinski, interrupting him
with great agitation.</p>

<p>“The shutters are well fastened,” adds the other.</p>

<p>“No matter&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;You must put them elsewhere.”
These words made me tremble.</p>

<p>“It is not possible, but,”&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;continues the
confident, and then whispered the rest of the sentence in his ear.</p>

<p>“Right,” says the Baron; “and let it be done instantly.” Then,
addressing himself to me, <ins class = "correction"
title = "open quote missing">“know</ins> that your brother and you must depart the day after
to-morrow: before you go, you shall see me again, and I will give you a
letter for Pulaski.”</p>

<p>I then went to rejoin Boleslas in the kitchen, where he was at
breakfast, who soon after presented me with a little bottle full of ink,
several pens, and some sheets of paper, which he had procured without
difficulty. I&nbsp;panted with desire to write to Lodoiska; and the only
difficulty that now remained, was to find a commodious place where I
might not be discovered by the curiosity of Dourlinski’s people.</p>

<p>They had already informed Boleslas that we could not again be
admitted into the apartment where we had spent the preceding night,
until the time should arrive when we were to retire to rest.
I&nbsp;soon, however, bethought myself of a stratagem which succeeded to
admiration.</p>

<p>The servants were drinking with my pretended brother, and politely
invited me to help them to empty a few flasks.</p>

<p>I swallowed, with a good grace, several glasses of bad wine in
succession: in a few minutes my legs seemed to totter, my tongue
faltered: I&nbsp;related a hundred pleasant and improbable tales to the
joyous company; in a word, I&nbsp;acted the <i>drunken man</i> so well,
that Boleslas himself became a dupe to my scheme, and actually trembled
lest, in a moment when I seemed disposed to communicate every thing, my
secret should escape.</p>

<h4>REMARKS ON MUSIC.</h4>

<p class = "center smaller">
(Continued from <a href = "#page108">page 108</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> sacred
scriptures afford almost the only materials from which any knowledge of
the Hebrew music can be drawn. In the rapid sketch, therefore of ancient
music which I mean to exhibit, very few observations are all that can
properly be given to that department of the subject.</p>

<p>Moses was educated by Pharoah’s daughter in all the literature and
elegant arts cultivated in Egypt. It is probable, therefore, that the
taste and style of Egyptian music would be infused in some degree into
that of the Hebrews. Music appears to have been interwoven thro’ the
whole tissue of religious ceremony in Palestine. The priesthood seem to
have been musicians hereditarily and by office. The prophets appear to
have accompanied their inspired effusions with music; and every prophet
like the present Improvisatori of Italy, seems to have been accompanied
by a musical instrument.</p>

<p>Music, vocal and instrumental, constituted a great part of the
funeral ceremonies of the Jews. The pomp and expence used on those
occasions advanced by degrees to an excessive extent. The number of
flute-players in the procession amounted sometimes to several hundreds,
and the attendance of the guests continued frequently for thirty
days.</p>

<p>The Hebrew language abounds with consonants, and has so few vowels,
that in the original alphabet they had no characters, it must,
therefore, have been harsh and unfavourable to music. Their instruments
of music were chiefly those of percussion, so that the music must have
been coarse and noisy: The vast numbers of performers too, whom it was
the taste of the Hebrews to collect together, could not with such
language and instruments produce any thing but clamour and jargon.
According to Josephus, there were 200,000 musicians at the dedication of
the temple of Solomon.</p>

<p>The history of King David furnishes us with very striking proofs of
his attachment to music. Saul being troubled in his mind, and
melancholy, was advised to apply to music as a remedy for his disorder:
“David took his harp, and played tunes of sweet melody, and Saul was
comforted.”</p>

<p>The Psalms of David, which glow with ardour of genius, of an
elevation of the most becoming sentiments, were, it is more than
probable, set to the most sublime and expressive music, such was the
attachment of the Hebrews to this art, and such was the proficiency they
made in it; and when they were in captivity in Babylon, they regretted
the loss of those songs which they had sung with rapture in the temple
of Jerusalem. Such are the circumstances from which only an idea of the
Hebrew music can be formed, for the Jews neither ancient nor modern have
ever had any characters peculiar to music; and the melodies used in
their religious ceremonies have at all times been entirely
traditional.</p>

“Shame! Where is thy blush?”</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">How</span> degrading to
human nature! Worse than the brute is he who endeavours to draw another
into a contest!</p>

<p>An instance occurred a few days since of a <i>battle</i> between two
persons, who (as I withhold their real names) I&nbsp;shall distinguish
by the titles of Willet and Martin. Willet had long been a visitor at
the house of the other, for what purpose I know not; but be it what it
may, his intentions, no doubt, were honourable. Martin has an amiable
sister, and report says, the heart of Willet has been smitten by her
charms; and when time permitted, and she consented, he intended to have
made her his bride.</p>

<p>His visits, it seems, were not very pleasing to the brother of the
young lady, who took an opportunity of loading him with a series of
epithets consisting of “<i>mean, low</i>,” &amp;c. &amp;c. To these
Willet scarcely deigned a reply. When Martin found the object of his
malice removed by his vile insinuations, he challenged him to
<i>fight</i>. He was forced to comply, though much against his
inclination, and both quitting the house, he found himself instantly
attacked in the open street, where a scene ensued that would have made
the unprincipled savage, were he present, blush with indignation.</p>

<p>In short, the challenger was worsted; he was not a match for his
antagonist, though he had the better of him in years. His mother and
sister saw the conflict from a window, and endeavoured to restore him to
reason, but without effect; he was quite transported with excess of
passion.</p>

<p>Martin was the aggressor, and his punishment was just. When he became
sensible that he had suffered sufficiently, he was conveyed home,
without enjoying the pleasure of beholding that bright luminary, the
sun, the cuffs he had received having entirely closed up the organs of
sight; to all appearance, a&nbsp;few more would have made him an
inhabitant of the world of spirits; but by a lucky turn of the wheel of
fortune, they were restrained.</p>

(Continued from <a href = "#page119">page 119</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“The</span> human soul, of
course, is already, in this life, connected with the members of the
invisible world, and this connection is lasting and essential, while
that with the body is accidental and transient. However a union of
substances, that is, of active natures, cannot be supposed to exist
without a reciprocal influence; consequently the human soul must have an
effective influence upon the spirits to whom she is linked, and the
members of the spiritual world must act reciprocally on our soul. But
why are we not equally sensible of these reciprocal influences and
communications, as of those which subsist between our soul and body? The
cause of this is very obvious. The human spirit can have a clear idea
only of the objects of the material world, because of its corporeal
organ; it is, therefore, not even capable of a clear immediate
contemplation of its own self, much less of its immaterial relations to
other spirits: the difference which exists between those ideas which
arise in our soul by means of its immateriality, and its communion with
spiritual beings, and the ideas which it receives by the medium of the
body, or abstracted from material objects, is so essential, that the
ideas of the former kind cannot come in connection with those of the
latter; for which reason we have either no notion at all of them, or, at
most, a&nbsp;very obscure one; however, we become plainly conscious of
them as soon as the union of the soul and its corporeal organ
ceases.”</p>

<p>“This, Hiermanfor, seems, in some measure to be the case when we are
sleeping, and the sensitive organs are resting from their occupations.
Should therefore those philosophers of antiquity, who have believed that
in our dreams we are capable of being influenced by superior beings, and
of receiving supernatural inspirations, be mistaken?”</p>

<p>“There is, certainly, some truth in this remark. I must, however,
observe, that we do not possess that capacity when dreaming, but when we
are fast asleep. It is commonly thought that we have only obscure
notions in the latter state, and this opinion arises from our not
recollecting them when we awake; however, on what ground can we conclude
therefrom that they have not been clear while we were sleeping? Such
ideas, perhaps, may be clearer and more extensive, than even the most
perspicuous when we are awake, because the activity of our soul is
neither modified nor confined by any thing whatever, the sensitive
organs being intirely at rest. However this very rest of our sensitive
organs, is the cause which prevents the re-production of these ideas
when we are awake, our sleeping body having no share in them, and,
consequently, being destitute of its concomitant notion of them; they,
of course, remain insulated in our soul, having
<span class = "pagenum">125b</span>
no connection at all with those ideas which arise within ourselves
before and after we are fast asleep, and in which our body takes a
greater or a smaller share. This is not the case with our dreams; for
when we are dreaming, the faculties of the soul do not act so pure and
uncontrouled as when we are fast asleep. Dreaming is an intermediate
state between waking and sleeping. We have then already, in some
measure, clear ideas, and interweave the actions of our soul with the
impressions of our exterior senses, whereby a strange, and sometimes
ridiculous mixture is engendered, which we partly recollect when we
awake.”</p>

<p>“You have, as yet, proved only the probability of clear notions
during our being fast asleep; could you not also prove their
reality?”</p>

<p>“Certainly! however these arguments do not belong to the theoretical
part of our philosophy. Yet I must beg of you to recollect, en passant,
the actions of some noctambulos, who sometimes, during the profoundest
sleep, shew more understanding than at any other time, but cannot
recollect those actions when awake?”</p>

<p>“This is true!” I exclaimed, “this throws an astonishing light upon
this matter.”</p>

<p>“Yet not only while asleep,” <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has superfluous open quote">the</ins> Irishman continued, “but also when
awake, many people can be capable of having a clear notion of their
connection with the spiritual world, and the influence of spirits upon
them. Yet the essential difference which exists between the notions of
<i>spirits</i> and those of <i>men</i> is a great impediment, which,
however, is not at all insurmountable. It is true than man cannot have
an <i>immediate</i> notion of those spiritual ideas, because of the
co-operation of his corporeal organs; however they can, in virtue of the
law of the association of ideas, produce in the human mind those images
which are related to them and consequently procreate analogical
representations of our senses, which, although they be not the spiritual
actions themselves, yet are their symbols.”</p>

<p>“I perceive what you are aiming at.”</p>

<p>“Examples will render the matter more intelligible to you. Experience
teaches that our superior intellectual notions, which are near a-kin to
the spiritual ideas, commonly assume a bodily garb, in order to render
themselves perspicuous. Thence the poet transforms wisdom into the
Goddess Minerva, the stings of conscience into furies, and personifies
virtues and vices; the mathematician describes time by a line, and is
there any philosopher who always forms an idea even of the Godhead,
without intermixing human qualities? In that manner ideas, which have
been imparted to us by spiritual influence, may dress themselves in the
symbols of that <i>language</i> which is common to us, and the presence
of a spirit which we perceive, assume the image of a <i>human
shape</i>&mdash;witness the late apparition of your
tutor.&mdash;&mdash;Thus the theory of all supernatural inspirations and
visions is ascertained; consequently the apparitions of spirits have
that in common with our dreams, that they represent to us effects which
are produced within ourselves, as if happening <i>without
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page126" id = "page126">126</a></span>
ourselves</i>; however, at the same time, they differ from them with
respect to their being really founded upon an effect from
<i>without</i>, a spiritual influence. However this influence cannot
reveal itself to our consciousness immediately, but only by means of
associated images of our fancy, which attain the vivacity of objects
really perceived. You see, therefore, what an essential difference there
is between the phantoms of our dreams, and the apparitions of spirits.
But here is the boundary of theory. The criterion whereby apparitions of
spirits, in every particular case, can be distinguished with certainty,
from vain phantoms, and supernatural inspirations from natural ideas,
and the means of effecting apparitions, and of obtaining assistance and
instructions from spiritual beings; these and several more things belong
to the practical part of the occult philosophy.</p>

<p>“Here, my Lord, I must conclude for the present, and drop the
curtain. Stress of time obliges me to abbreviate my discourse on a
subject which would not be exhausted in many days; however I may safely
leave to your own understanding the finishing and enlargement of this
sketch. Suffice it that I have enabled you to comprehend the apparition
of your friend, and to see that reason does not pronounce judgment
against subjects of this nature, but rather is the only mean which
affords us light and certainty with respect to them. The theory which I
have given you may, at the same time, serve you to judge whether it will
be worth your trouble to be initiated in the mysteries of the practical
part of this philosophy. However, I&nbsp;must tell you, that no mortal
who has not sanctified himself by bridling his sensitive nature, and
purifying his spiritual faculties, can be admitted to that sanctuary.
Are you resolved to do this?”</p>

<p>“I am, put me to the test!”</p>

<p>“Then depart with the first dawn of day for Ma**id, without taking
leave of the Countess.”</p>

<p>The Irishman could not have chosen a severer trial, nor demanded a
greater sacrifice. The combat which I had to fight with my heart, before
I could come to a resolution, was short but dreadful.<span class =
"locked">---</span>I promised the Irishman to execute his will.</p>

<p>“Well!” said he, “then hear what measures you are to take. As soon as
you shall be arrived at Ma**id, you must, without delay, wait upon the
Prime Minister, Oliv**ez, and the Secretary of State Suma*ez, but take
care not to discover your political views to either of them; pretend
that you intend to stay some time at Ma**id merely for the sake of
amusement. Repeat your visits till you have gained their confidence.
Your winning demeanor, my Lord, and your intimate connection with
Vascon*ellos will render this conquest easy.<span class =
"locked">---</span>Farewell, at Ma**id we shall meet again!”</p>

<p>We parted. The Irishman returned once more. “Your manner of life
while at Ma**id,” said he, “will require great expences, and you must be
well provided with money. I&nbsp;have taken care that you shall be well
supplied with that needful article. You will find in your apartment a
sum which you may dispose of at pleasure.” So saying, he left me
suddenly.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">126b</span>
<p>On coming home, I found on my table two bags with money, each of them
containing a thousand ducats. Pietro told me they had been brought by a
servant of the Irish Captain.</p>

<p>No one will doubt that I was now entirely devoted to the Irishman. By
his discourse at the burying place he had <i>persuaded</i>, and by his
liberality <i>convinced</i> me, that I could not do better than to let
myself be guided entirely by him; and as I at first had been determined
to this by the conquering superiority of his soul, so I was now
confirmed in it by the applause of my reason. Nay, if the Irishman
should now have offered to break off all connection with me,
I&nbsp;should have courted his friendship, so much had I been charmed by
the profound wisdom of his discourse. Not the least vestige of mistrust
against his secret power was left in my soul, and the very regard for
philosophy which but lately had prejudiced me against him, was now one
of the strongest bonds that chained me to him. How agreeably was I
surprised to find in <i>Reason</i> herself, whom I formerly had thought
to be the principal adversary of the belief in miracles, the most
convincing arguments for the same, and to have been conquered with the
same weapons which I had been fighting with against the Irishman,
without having the least reason to reproach him with having had recourse
to any stratagem whatever. The frankness and strength of argument which
distinguished every step of his philosophical instruction, were to me
the most unexceptionable security for the justness of the result. If he
had delivered his arguments in a flowery and mysterious language,
supported by the charms of declamation, then I should certainly have
suspected them; however he had made use of the cool, simple and clear
language of reason, divested of all sophistical artifices; started from
principles which are generally received, drew no conclusions to which he
was not entitled by his premises, combatted errors and prejudices upon
which he could have founded <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for surreptitious">surreptious</ins> conclusions; nay,
it appeared as if he, unmindful of what he was to prove, had left it
entirely to the course of his impartial inquiry whither it would lead
him, and I beheld myself, with astonishment, on the conclusion of it, at
the mark from which the road we had taken threatened to lead us
astray.</p>

<p>I cannot describe the wonderful bold ideas which the instructions I
had received produced in my mind, nor the awfully agreeable sensations
which those ideas were accompanied with. The rising sun surprised me in
that indescribable state of mind, and reminded me by his rays, that it
was time to set off.</p>

a Censor.&mdash;&mdash;But let him emerge from his closet, let him enter

exercise, while he beholds his neighbours industriously and chearfully
employed, and he becomes quite another man. If we now penetrate his mind
we find him no longer disturbed by imaginary evils, or vexed with
supposed injuries. He begins to view mankind as his brethren, and fellow

the wanderer to the right path, with a friendly commiseration for his

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">It</span> was low ebb when
our vessel made the offing of Dublin bay, and it being then night, we
lay at anchor till morning. The moon shone remarkably bright, and
reflected in silver shades upon the sea, which waved with a gentle
heaving<span class = "locked">---</span>a murmur<span class =
"locked">---</span>it was nature sighing with a love-creating
respiration.</p>

<p>For some leagues on each side the harbour’s mouth it was encircled
with a fleet of herring boats, and I not being inclined to sleep,
accompanied the captain in the yawl, to visit them.</p>

<p>The drawing of the herring nets, is, perhaps, the most pleasing and
beautiful sight the human mind can conceive: the fish, as they are
hawled up the vessel’s side, sparkle like diamonds.</p>

<p>I could not but express my surprize to the captain at the quantity
taken; and by him was informed, that these sculls approached the coast
by millions and tens of millions, extending many miles, and swimming
several fathoms deep over one another. They make their way through the
sea, as men do on earth, each individual striving to be uppermost, and
with this stronger circumstance of similarity, that the fish which gets
uppermost is always in most danger.</p>

<p>“I shall eat half a dozen of these herrings,” said the captain, as he
took about a dozen out of a net without leave or notice, to the boatman,
who made no objection. “I&nbsp;shall eat half a dozen of these
herrings,” said he, “when I return to my vessel.”<span class =
"locked">---</span>“What, captain, must six lives be sacrificed to
satisfy your appetite at one meal?”</p>

<p>For half a moment I was converted by this reflection to the religion
of the Indian Bramins, who refuse all animal food; but the captain who
was a philosopher, as suddenly induced me to apostatize from my new
opinion.</p>

<p>A number of large porpoises or sea hogs, were sporting round.<span
class = "locked">---</span>“Why not eat them?” said the captain,
pointing to the porpoises; “those creatures feed upon herrings, and
innumerable great fish feed upon them; and it is the same to the
herring, whether he is eaten by a porpoise or by a man.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">129b</span>
<p>“Very true,” said I, “there are sea monsters, who live upon their
fellow-creatures as well as land monsters, who devour each other.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible to understand those affairs, or the reason of
them,” observed the captain; “I&nbsp;have got a microscope on board, and
I’ll prove to you that innumerable animals perish at every suction of
your breath. The great difference between voracious fish, voracious
quadrupeds, voracious birds, and voracious man, is this: the first three
classes eat to satisfy hunger only, and devour without preparation; but
the cruelty which man inflicts upon those creatures Providence has
empowered him to use for his sustenance, may be considered as a species
of ingratitude, which of all crimes merits the severest punishment.”</p>

<h4 class = "smallcaps">Wisdom and Virtue.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Wisdom</span> or virtue is
nothing more than the disposition to attain and enjoy the greatest
happiness, with the knowledge how to attain and to bestow&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Wisdom has ever some benevolent end in her purposes and actions; on
the contrary, folly either mistakes evil for good, or, when she assumes
the nature of vice, entertains a malevolent intention.</p>

<p>The advantages and defects of nature mould be considered as common to
society: the weak have a claim to the assistance of the strong; the
strong derive a pleasure from assisting the weak; and the wise are so
far happy as the well disposed partake of their wisdom.</p>

<p>There is no one virtue that includes not, in a general sense, all
other virtues. Wisdom cannot subsist without justice, temperance, and
fortitude, for wisdom is the sum of all these. It is impossible to be
just without temperance, or temperate without fortitude, and so
alternately of the rest.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I made</span>, without
delay, the requisite preparations, and in a quarter of an hour, stepped
in my carriage. I&nbsp;looked once more back to the spot where Amelia
resided, and drove through the city-gate.</p>

<p>At the first stage I wrote to her that an unforeseen important
accident had forced me to set out on my journey so early in the morning
that it would have been unbecoming to pay her the promised farewell
visit; I&nbsp;vowed to return on pinions of love, as soon as my business
at M****d should be settled. I&nbsp;painted with lively colours all the
pains of separation, and all the tenderness of an afflicted heart, in
order to convince Amelia, that I had been forced by stern necessity to
depart without seeing her once more. Alas! the farther the rolling
carriage removed me from the dear object of my love, the more I grew
sensible of the greatness of the sacrifice which I had made to the
Irishman. I&nbsp;examined my letters and papers in order to divert my
gloomy thoughts, and found one more copy of a letter from the Irishman
which I had not yet decyphered. The following is the result of my
endeavours to unfold its contents:</p>

<p class = "inset">“<span class = "smallcaps">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>“My designs on Miguel had very near been ruined by the loss of his
life, and in some measure I myself have been the cause of his having
been hurried to the brink of destruction. But who could have foreseen
such an event! With the leave of your Excellency, I&nbsp;shall relate
the incident at large.</p>

<p>“I had sent one part of my servants to follow Miguel on his journey.
I&nbsp;myself staid behind in order to make an attempt of restoring the
health of the Countess, for whose life the ignorance of her physicians
had made me tremble. The success I met with surprised my most sanguine
expectation. Some drops of an electuary which I poured into the mouth of
the Countess produced so sudden an effect, that, in a few hours, the
most unequivocal signs of returning health were perceived. As soon as I
had been informed of this desirable change, I&nbsp;followed Miguel with
the rest of my people; having previously ordered the valet of the
Countess to write three days after to the Duke, that the Countess was
dead&mdash;and in a few days later, that I had recalled her to life. At
the same time I requested him to desire his dismission from Amelia, and
to follow me, because I wanted his assistance in the execution of my
designs. The view I had in commanding him to inform the Duke of Amelia’s
pretended death, was to convince myself by the manner in which he should
receive that intelligence, whether his love to the Countess had been
only a transient attachment, or whether his passion for her was of a
more serious nature, and what degree it had attained. I&nbsp;need not
explain to your Excellency, how necessary this knowledge was to me. The
second commission had no other aim,
<span class = "pagenum">130b</span>
than to pour balsam in Miguel’s wound, and at the same time, to make me
appear to him a miracle-working being, and his and Amelia’s friend;
whereby I expected to gain his confidence.</p>

<p>“I pursued my road with so much speed, that I overtook Miguel before
he had finished one half of his journey, and joined my people, who
preceded me. As soon as the Duke had arrived at the place of his
destination, and we along with him, I&nbsp;quartered my people in
different places in such a manner, that he was surrounded by them from
all sides. I&nbsp;took a convenient house in the suburbs for myself, in
order to escape his looks with greater safety.</p>

<p>“On the third day after our arrival, Miguel received the letter by
which he was informed of the Countess’s death. The effects which this
intelligence produced upon him must have been a kind of frenzy. One of
my people who watched all his steps, informed me late in the evening, he
had seen Miguel rushing out of his house with every mark of despair in
his countenance, and running with such a velocity that he and his
comrade hardly had been able so follow him. He added, that Miguel after
two hours roaming about, had stopped not far from hence, at the banks of
a river, where he was walking up and down, absorbed in profound
reverie.</p>

<p>“Soon after a second messenger told me, Miguel had plunged into the
river, but one of his comrades who had watched him narrowly, and leaped
after him, had saved him, and was going to carry him to my house.
A&nbsp;few minutes after, Miguel was brought by some of my people. He
resembled a corpse, the palpitation of his pulse was scarcely
perceptible, and he was entirely bereft of his recollection.
I&nbsp;ordered him instantly to be carried to a spacious empty vault,
and while some of my men endeavoured to restore him to the use of his
senses, I&nbsp;was making preparations to chastise him severely when he
should have recovered from his stupor.</p>

<p>“As soon as my servants perceived that he was recovering, I ordered
him to be carried into the middle of the vault, and placed myself in
deep disguise opposite him at a considerable distance, making a signal
to those who were present to retire to an adjoining apartment, and to
take the candles with them. No sooner was every thing in order, than I
perceived by a deep groan of Miguel, that he had recovered his
recollection. His state of mind when awaking, must have been very
strange. His recollection told him, that he had plunged into the river,
in a place where he saw nobody present, and now he awoke in a dry,
empty, and spacious dark room: he must have fancied he awoke in another
world; and this idea seems to have thrilled him with its acutest
pungency, for he uttered a loud scream which made the vault resound.<a
class = "blank" name = "tag130" id = "tag130" href = "#note130">*</a>
This was the signal for which my people had been
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page131" id = "page131">131</a></span>
waiting in the adjoining chamber. They kindled a pole which was fixed
near an aperture in the wall, and enveloped with flax, and wetted with
spirit of wine, which spread a faint light through the spacious vault.
The astonishment which Miguel was seized with, when looking all around
and seeing nothing but a man wrapt in a scarlet cloak, surpasses all
powers of description. His anxiety encreased when he saw me staring at
him without replying a word to his questions, and heard one of my people
exclaim, in a doleful accent, woe! woe! woe! When I at last stepped
forth and made myself known to him, he prostrated himself, as if in the
presence of a superior being. I&nbsp;read him a severe lecture on his
rash deed, and at the same time endeavoured to rouse his ambition for
the service of his country, in which I succeeded. A&nbsp;soft music
began at once in the adjoining chamber, on a signal which I made to my
people. The melodious strains of a harp and a flute were accompanied by
the sweet notes of an harmonious voice, which announced to the
astonished Miguel that Amelia was alive. His rapture bordered on frenzy.
I&nbsp;ordered him to be silent, blind-folded him and delivered him to
the care of a servant, whom I secretly ordered to conduct him to his
hotel, and to return no answer to his questions. My deputy acquitted
himself extremely well of his trust. He led him silently to his hotel,
and when Miguel turned round the corner of the house, unfastened the
bandage which blind-folded his eyes, and concealed himself in a house,
the door of which was open. Miguel must have been strangely situated,
when after a few steps the bandage dropped from his eyes and nobody was
seen around him. Very fortunately the night was far advanced, and the
whole affair remained concealed.</p>

<p>“Thus happily ended an adventure which had begun in a manner so
inauspicious.</p>

<p>“However, Paleski has <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘commited’">committed</ins> a foolish trick, which I cannot forgive him.
He desired his dismission from the Countess, which being refused by his
Lady, who imagined him to be a faithful servant, he left her
<i>clandestinely</i>. He shall smart for this inconsiderate action.</p>

<p>“I am with the greatest respect,</p>

<p class = "center">“&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.”</p>

<p>As far as this letter informed me that no superior power had had a
share in the above mentioned adventure, it contained nothing that was
new to me, for the Irishman himself had not concealed from me, that all
the wonderful adventures which had happened to me before Paleski’s
confession had been the effect of illusion; however, it was important to
me <ins class = "correction" title = "word missing">to</ins> learn
<i>how</i>, and by what artifices I had been deceived. I&nbsp;cannot but
confess that this natural explanation of the whole affair excited my
astonishment at the Irishman, not less than those adventures had
surprised me at the time when I believed him to be a supernatural being,
and that I ardently wished to have cleared up several other events of
that epocha which I could not unriddle.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">131b</span>
<p>Soon after my arrival at M****d, I went to pay a visit to the
minister. He received me very kindly, and discoursed above an hour with
me, although he was so over charged with state-affairs that no stranger
could get access to him. I&nbsp;was not less successful with the
Secretary of State, in whose favour I ingratiated myself so much in the
course of half an hour, that he professed himself extremely happy in
having got acquainted with me. Both of them invited me to visit them
frequently during my stay at M****d, an invitation which I took care to
make the best use&nbsp;of.</p>

<p>I perceived soon with astonishment and joy, that I was getting nearer
the mark much sooner than I had expected first. Though I am of opinion
that the visibly growing favour of these two courtiers was partly
founded on personal attachment, yet the Irishman had not been mistaken
when he told me, that the relation which existed between myself and
Vascon*ellos would render the access to their confidence easier.
Sum**ez, the Secretary of State, enjoyed the most intimate confidence of
the Minister, and was related to Vascon*ellos. Therefore the friendship
of the latter paved for me the road to Sum**ez, and the friendship of
Sum**ez to Oliva*ez. The two secretaries of State were the chief
administrators of the government; Sum**ez in the council of Sp**n, at
Ma***d, and Vascon*ellos in the council of state at L*sbon, and
consequently were the vice-tyrants of my native country, who jointly
executed the designs of Oliv**ez, who in the name of the King of Sp**n
was at the helm of despotism.</p>

<p>That the Irishman had very well calculated these concatenations, will
appear by the subsequent plan which he founded upon them. I&nbsp;had
wrote to Amelia, and Lady Delier, as soon as I had arrived at M****d,
and now received an answer from both of them. Every line of the former
breathed heavenly love and kindness; the tender and amiable sentiments
of her soul, purified by the trials of misfortunes, were palpably
displayed in her letter, as in an unspotted mirror. O! how many a time
did I kiss, read, and re-peruse it, till at length, what a sweet
delusion of my enraptured imagination! I&nbsp;fancied I saw the amiable
writer before me, and heard from her lips the words which were written
upon the paper.&mdash;</p>

This is a mistake, for we know by the Duke’s own account, that he
uttered this scream because he felt himself pulled down by an invisible
hand when he was going to get up. The Irishman having known nothing if
this circumstance, it is probable that the unknown cause of this pulling
down, was no other than a foot of the Duke, with which he, in his
stupor, kept his cloak down, when he was getting up, without
knowing&nbsp;it.</p>

<h5 class = "six"><span class = "extended">MARIA’S
NARRATIVE</span>.</h5>

<p>Under the specious pretext of love, Frederick has bereaved me of all
the happiness and comfort of life. While I fondly dreamed of future
bliss he became a visitor at our house. I&nbsp;knew not then that ’twas
to see me alone he came, as he had not given me the least hint of it;
but my parents imagined he was wooing me to become his bride.</p>

<p>It was some time before he paid any direct addresses to me. He then
said that he had long been in love with me, but forbore to mention it
sooner as he feared I would discard him; and ended with asking if he
might be permitted to hope. I&nbsp;gave him no positive answer, until he
enquired whether I had a partiality for any other. I&nbsp;told him I had
not. His countenance brightened at this. He took my hand, and with all
the fervor of love raised it to his lips. When he departed, he said,
that was the happiest moment of his life.</p>

<p>After this his visits were more frequent. One evening I was left
entirely alone, the family had gone to the theatre. Mrs. <span class =
"locked">M&mdash;&mdash;</span>, a&nbsp;lady from England, made her
first appearance on the New-York stage. A&nbsp;slight indisposition
occasioned my not being of the party. Frederick, it seems, knew I was
alone, and came in just after they had departed.</p>

<p>The next week had been appointed for our nuptials. He entered rather
dejected. I&nbsp;enquired the reason of his melancholy. He said he was
fearful I did not love him sincerely. I&nbsp;asked if I had ever given
him reason for such a suspicion; and said that all beside him were
indifferent to me. Here his countenance again assumed its wonted
brightness. “Do you then indeed behold me with pleasure?” said he.
“I&nbsp;know that on you alone depends my felicity<span class =
"locked">---</span>should you be cruel, Frederick would cease to exist.”
He took my hand, and imprinted on it a profusion of kisses. To me he
appeared sincere, and I viewed him as singled out by fate for my
companion thro’ life.</p>

<p>“Ah! my Maria!” continued he, still holding my hand clasped in his,
“did you but know the happiness your words have given me<span class =
"locked">---</span>It is indescribable.<span class =
"locked">---</span>Still
<span class = "pagenum">132b</span>
manifest for me your love, and every hour of my life will study to
deserve it. Should I ever prove myself unworthy your tender regard,
I&nbsp;should abhor myself.” He continued protestations of his love<span
class = "locked">---</span>the minutes were swift&mdash;and ere the
evening had elapsed he triumphed over my innocence and credulity<span
class = "locked">---</span>in fine, he left me miserable.</p>

<p>When my parents returned I beheld myself degraded below them, and
unfit for their company. I&nbsp;sat in a musing posture. They attributed
my want of spirits to the head-ach, which had occasioned my staying at
home, and endeavoured to enliven me by giving an account of the
entertainments, and the excellent performance of Mrs. <span class =
"locked">M&mdash;&mdash;</span>. I&nbsp;paid no attention to what they
said. To bed I went, but not to close my eyes: Sleep had fled me. In the
morning I had a slight fever, and was at times delirious. In a few days
I recovered sufficiently to learn that Frederick had set out for France
the day after he rendered me so completely miserable. This occasioned a
relapse, and I had approached the verge of the grave. My friends were
weeping over me, expecting every moment to be my last. I&nbsp;wished not
for life; I&nbsp;sought for death as the only means to conceal my shame.
But it pleased Heaven to raise me, contrary to all expectation. In two
weeks from the time I began to mend, I&nbsp;had strength sufficient to
leave my room, I&nbsp;then found it too true that my deceiver had left
home, and did not expect to return in two years.</p>

<p>I dreaded staying any longer where I expected the resentment of my
father, when he should become acquainted with my disgrace. I&nbsp;left
the house under cover of the night, unperceived. I&nbsp;took with me a
small bundle of clothes, and some trifle in cash, which were my own. By
working I hoped to subsist until Frederick’s return; for I still thought
his voyage was of necessity, and unexpected. The money was soon gone,
and almost every article I could possibly spare. I&nbsp;expected to
starve. In this dilemma, I&nbsp;chanced to hear of a place where a young
woman was wanted for the upper servant in the kitchen. I&nbsp;applied,
and obtained it. The wages were liberal, and I had not the more
laborious part; I&nbsp;endeavoured to give satisfaction to my employer,
I&nbsp;lived in this manner until I was taken ill, when I gave birth to
this child&mdash;I called him after his father.</p>

<p>My recovery was slow; and when I could walk I was unable to work as
before; consequently I was forced to give up my place. Since then I have
wholly subsisted on the charity of others.</p>

<p>This morning, by accident, I beheld the cause of my woes. I
determined to speak with him although he was in company. When I first
accosted him, he disregarded me. I&nbsp;told him I was in a poor state
of health, and requested only a small boon. “Is that your child?” he
asked. “Yes,” I&nbsp;replied, “and his name is Frederick.” He looked me
in the face, for I perceived until then he did not know me&mdash;“I have
nothing for you!” he exclaimed in an angry tone, and passed on with his
companions. My head felt light, and I certainly should have dropped on
the pavement, had not heaven sent you to my relief<ins class =

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“Gentlemen</span>,” said
he, to the astonished Bacchanals, “my brother’s head is not very strong
to-day: it is perhaps in consequence of his wound; let us not therefore
either speak to or drink any more with him; for I am afraid of his
health, and indeed you would oblige me exceedingly if you would assist
me to carry him to his bed.”&mdash;“To his own bed?” says one of them:
“that is impossible! But I will most willingly lend him my chamber.”
They accordingly laid hold of me, and conveyed me into a garret, of
which a bed, a&nbsp;table, and a chair, formed the sole movables. Having
shut me up in this paltry apartment, they instantly left me. This was
all that I wanted, for the moment that I was alone, I&nbsp;immediately
sat down to write a long letter to Lodoiska.</p>

<p>I began by fully justifying myself from the crimes of which I had
been accused by Pulaski: I&nbsp;then recounted every thing that had
occurred since the first moment of our separation, until that when I had
entered the castle of Dourlinski: I&nbsp;detailed the particulars of my
conversation with the Baron: I&nbsp;concluded by assuring her of the
most tender and the most respectful passion, and swore to her, that the
moment she gave me the necessary information concerning her situation,
I&nbsp;would expose myself to every danger, in order to finish her
horrid captivity.</p>

<p>As soon as my letter was sealed, I delivered myself up to a variety
of reflections, which threw me into a strange perplexity. Was it
actually Lodoiska who had thrown those tiles into the garden? Would
Pulaski have had the injustice to punish his daughter for an attachment
which he himself had approved? Would he have had the inhumanity to
plunge her into a frightful prison? And even if the hatred he had sworn
to me had blinded him so much, how was it possible that Dourlinski would
thus have condescended to have become the minister of his vengeance?</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, for these three last long months, on purpose
to disguise myself, I&nbsp;had only worn tattered clothes: the fatigues
of a tedious journey, and my chagrin, had altered me greatly; and who
but a mistress could have been able to discover Lovzinski in the gardens
of Dourlinski? Besides, had I not seen the name of Lodoiska traced upon
the tile? Had not Dourlinski himself acknowledged that Lodoiska had been
a prisoner with him? It is true, he had added that she had made her
escape; but was not this incredible? And wherefore that hatred which
Dourlinski had vowed against me, without knowing my person? What
occasioned that look of inquietude, when it was told
<span class = "pagenum">133b</span>
him, that the emissaries of Pulaski occupied a chamber that looked into
his garden? And why above all that appearance of terror, when I
announced to him the arrival of my pretended master?</p>

<p>All these circumstances were well calculated to throw me into the
greatest agitation. I&nbsp;ruminated over this frightful and mysterious
adventure, which it was impossible for me to explain. For two hours,
I&nbsp;unceasingly put new questions to myself, to which I was
exceedingly embarrassed to make any reply; when at length Boleslas came
to see if I had recovered from my debauch. I&nbsp;had but little
difficulty in convincing him that my inebriety was mere affectation;
after which we went down together to the kitchen, where we spent the
rest of the day. What a night! none in my whole life ever appeared so
long, not even that which followed.</p>

<p>At length the attendants conducted us to our chamber, where they shut
us up, as on the former occasion, without any light: it was yet two
tedious hours until midnight. At the first stroke of the clock, we
gently opened the shutters and the casement. I&nbsp;then prepared to
jump into the garden; but my embarrassment was equal to my despair, when
I found myself obstructed by means of iron bars. “Behold,” said I to
Boleslas, “what the cursed confident of Dourlinski whispered in his ear!
behold what his odious master approved, when he said, <i>let it be done
instantly!</i> behold what they have been working at during the day! it
was on this account that they prevented us from entering the
chamber.”</p>

<p>“My lord, they have stood on the outside,” replies Boleslas; “for
they have not perceived that the shutter has been forced.”</p>

<p>“Alas! whether they have perceived it or not,” exclaim I with
violence, “what does it signify? This fatal grating destroys all my
hopes: it insures the slavery of Lodoiska&mdash;it insures my
death.”</p>

<p>“Yes, without doubt, it insures thy death!” repeats a person, at the
same time opening the door; and immediately after, Dourlinski, preceded
by several armed men, and followed by others carrying flambeaux, enter
our prison <i>sabre in hand</i>. “Traitor!” exclaims he, while
addressing himself to me with a look in which fury was visibly depicted,
“I&nbsp;have heard all&mdash;I know who you are,&mdash;your servant has
discovered your name. Tremble! Of all the enemies of Lovzinski,
I&nbsp;am the most implacable!”</p>

<p>“Search them,” continues he, turning to his attendants: they
accordingly rushed in upon me; and as I was without arms, I&nbsp;made an
useless resistance. They accordingly robbed me of my papers, and of the
letter I had just written to Lodoiska. Dourlinski exhibited a thousand
signs of impatience while reading it, and was scarce able to contain
himself.</p>

<p>“Lovzinski,” says he to me, endeavouring to smother his rage,
“I&nbsp;already deserve all your hatred; I&nbsp;shall soon merit it
still more: in the mean time, you must remain with your worthy confident
in this chamber, to which you are so partial.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page134" id = "page134">134</a></span>
<p>After uttering these words, he left me; and having double-locked the
door, he placed a centinel on the outside, and another in the garden,
opposite to the window.</p>

<p>Figure to yourself the horrible situation into which Boleslas and
myself were now plunged. My misfortunes were at their height; but those
of Lodoiska affected me more than my own! How great must be her
uneasiness! She expects Lovsinski, and Lovsinski abandons her! But
no&mdash;Lodoiska knows me too well; she can never suspect me of such
base perfidy. Lodoiska! she will judge of her lover by herself; she will
think Lovsinski partakes her lot, since he does not succour her<span
class = "locked">---</span>Alas! the very certainty of my misfortunes
will augment her own!</p>

<p>On the next day, they gave us provisions through the grating of our
window; and by the quality of the viands which they furnished us with,
Boleslas augured the most sinister events. Being, however less unhappy
than myself, he supported his fate much more courageously. He offered me
my share of the mean repast which he was about to make; I&nbsp;would not
eat: he pressed me; but it was in vain! for existence was become an
insupportable burden to&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>“Ah! live!” said he at length, shedding a torrent of tears: “live;
and if not for Boleslas, let it be for Lodoiska!” These words made the
most lively impression on my mind; they even re-animated my courage; and
hope having once more re-entered my heart, I&nbsp;embraced my faithful
servant. “O&nbsp;my friend!” exclaimed I at the same time with
transport, “my true friend! I&nbsp;have been the occasion of thy ruin,
and yet my misfortunes affect thee more than thine own! Yes, Boleslas!
yes! I&nbsp;will live for Lodoiska; I&nbsp;will live for thee: if just
Heaven shall restore me to my fortune and rank, you shall see that your
master is not ungrateful!” We now embraced once more.</p>

<p>Ah! how much do misfortunes connect men together! how sweet it is,
when one suffers, to hear another unfortunate address a word of
consolation to him!</p>

<p>We had groaned in this prison for no less than twelve days, when
several ruffians came to drag me forth on purpose to conduct me to
Dourlinski. Boleslas wished to follow, but they repulsed him with
violence: however they permitted me to speak to him for a single moment.
I&nbsp;then drew from a private pocket a ring which I had worn for ten
years, and said to Boleslas:<span class = "locked">---</span>“This ring
was given me by M. de P. when we were at college together at Warsaw:
take it, my friend; and preserve it for my sake. If Dourlinski this day
consummates his treason by my assassination, and if he should at length
permit you to leave this castle, go, find your king, recall to his
memory our ancient attachment, recount my misfortunes to him; he will
recompense you, and succour Lodoiska. Adieu my friend!”</p>

<p>After this, I was conducted to the apartment of Dourlinski. As soon
as the door opened, I&nbsp;perceived a lady
<span class = "pagenum">134b</span>
in a chair, who had just fainted away. I&nbsp;approached her<span class
= "locked">---</span>it was Lodoiska! Heavens! how much did I find her
altered!<span class = "locked">---</span>but she was still handsome!
“Barbarian!” exclaimed I, addressing myself to Dourlinski; and at the
voice of her lover, Lodoiska recovered her senses.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear Lovsinski,” says she, looking wistfully at me, “do you
know what this infamous wretch has proposed? do you know at what price
he has offered me your liberty?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cries the furious chieftain, “yes, I am determined upon it:
you see that he is in my power; and if in three days I do not obtain my
wishes, he shall be no more!” I&nbsp;endeavoured to throw myself on my
knees at the feet of Lodoiska; but my guards prevented me:
“I&nbsp;behold you again, and all my ills are forgotten, Lodoiska<span
class = "locked">---</span>death has now no longer any thing terrifying
in its aspect.”</p>

<p>“Wretch,” added I, looking sternly at Dourlinski, “know that Pulaski
will avenge his daughter! know that the king will avenge his
friend!”</p>

<p>“Let him be carried away!” was the only reply made by the ferocious
palatine.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaims Lodoiska, “my love has been your ruin!” I was about to
answer, but the attendants dragged me out, and re-conducted me to
prison.</p>

<p>Boleslas received me with inexpressible transports of joy; he avowed
to me that he thought me lost for ever, and I recounted to him how that
my death was but deferred. The scene of which I had been a witness,
confirmed all my suspicions; it was evident that Pulaski was ignorant of
the unworthy treatment which his daughter experienced; it was also
evident that Dourlinski, old, amorous, and jealous, was determined, at
any rate, to satisfy his passions.</p>

<p>In the mean time, two of the days allowed by Dourlinski for the
determination of Lodoiska, had already expired; we were now in the midst
of the night which preceded the fatal third; I&nbsp;could not sleep, and
I was walking hastily about my prison. All at once I heard the cry of
“To arms! to arms!” The most frightful howlings prevailed on the
outside, and a great commotion took place within the castle. The
centinel placed at our window, left his post. Boleslas and I were able
to distinguish the voice of Dourlinski, calling and encouraging his
followers; and we soon distinctly heard the clashing of swords, the
cries of the wounded, and the groans of the dying. The noise which at
first was very great seemed at length to die away. It recommenced soon
after; it redoubled; and at length we heard a shout of “Victory!”</p>

<p>To this frightful tumult, a still more frightful silence ensues. In a
short time, a&nbsp;low crackling sound is heard to approach us; the air
seems to hiss with violence; the night becomes less dark; the trees in
the garden assume a red and warm tint; we fly to the window: the flames
are devouring the castle of Dourlinski! they approach
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page135" id = "page135">135</a></span>
the chamber in which we were confined, from all sides; and, to overwhelm
me with new horror, the most piercing shrieks are uttered from that
tower in which I knew that Lodoiska was imprisoned!</p>

<p>The fire becoming every moment more violent, was about to communicate
to the chamber in which we were shut up, and the flames already began to
curl around the base of the tower in which Lodoiska was immured!</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">During</span> the late war
in America, when drafts were made from the militia to recruit the
continental army, a&nbsp;Captain gave liberty to the men, who were
drafted from his company, to make their objections, if they had any,
against going into the service. Accordingly, one of them who had an
impediment in his speech, came up to the captain and made his bow. “What
is your objection?” said the captain. “I&nbsp;ca-a-ant
go,”&mdash;answers the man, “because I st-st-stutter.” “Stutter,” says
the captain, “you don’t go there to talk, but to fight.” “Ay, but

<h4>AN ESSAY ON PATIENCE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> man of a frantic
heated imagination considers patience as flowing from a meanness of
soul, a&nbsp;dastardly disposition, the last resource of cowards. But
the man of real sagacity, who can view things through a dispassionate
medium, discovers in it all the genuine marks of a noble mind. It is
supported by hope, and is entirely unacquainted with every species of
despair, the constant companion of the lowness of sentiment. Patience is
so strong a barrier against every kind of disgrace, that all our ills
lose the greatest part of their power by opposing this virtue to them;
it combats all opponents, and every conflict is a victory. It honourably
resists the greatest hardships of this world, and sweetens the bitters
of adversity in such a manner, that we scarce perceive we are
unfortunate. It is one of those virtues that constantly carries its own
reward; for the very practice of it makes us sensible of its benefits.
The Emperor M.&nbsp;Aurelius often said, that Cæsar acquired the empire
by the sword, Augustus by inheritance, Caligula by the merits of his
father, Nero by tyranny, Titus by having vanquished Judea, but for his
part, though of low extraction, he had obtained it by patience.</p>

<p>Whatever crosses and misfortunes we meet with, and however heavy
their burden, they cannot overwhelm us whilst we are not abandoned by
patience: on the contrary, they become proportionally lightened as we
resolutely exercise this virtue. As every thing in nature has its
contrast, so patience is the opposite to despair; wherefore the
Christians consider it as an heavenly grace, and the philosophers of
antiquity pronounced it the last efforts of a firm and generous soul. It
is very nearly allied to courage, which cannot shine without opponents;
in like manner this virtue disappears as soon as misfortunes desert us.
Patience is the most generous of all friends, never appearing in
prosperity; but when our miseries attain a pitch that threatens all our
future happiness, she never fails to offer her assistance to those
really inclined to avail themselves of her kindness. Patience is the
birthright of the wise, an inheritance precluded from fools, who are
never the architects of their own good fortune, but frequently of their
own misery.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">137b</span>
<p>The <i>Spectator</i> observes, that resolution in an assassin is,
according to reason, quite as laudable as knowledge and wisdom exercised
in the defence of an ill cause. Those men only are truly great who place
their ambition rather in acquiring to themselves the conscience of
worthy enterprises, than in the prospect of glory which attends it.
These exalted spirits would rather be secretly the authors of events
which are serviceable to mankind, than, without being such, to have the
public fame of it. Where, therefore, an eminent merit is robbed by
artifice or detraction, it does but encrease by such endeavours of its
enemies; the impotent pains which are taken to sully it or disguise it
among a croud, to the injury of an individual, will naturally produce
the contrary effect; the fire will blaze out and burn up all the
attempts to smother what they cannot extinguish. There is but one thing
necessary to keep the possession of true glory, which is to hear the
opposers of it with patience, and preserve the virtue by which it was
acquired. When a person is thoroughly persuaded that he ought neither to
admire, wish for, nor pursue any thing but what is exactly his duty; it
is not in the power of seasons, persons, or accident, to diminish his
value. He only is a great man who can neglect the applauses of the
multitude, and enjoy himself independent of its favours. This is indeed
an arduous task, but it should comfort a glorious spirit that it is the
highest step to which human nature can arrive. Triumph, applause,
acclamations, are dear to the mind of man; but it is still a more
exquisite delight to say to yourself, you have done well, than to hear
the whole human race pronounce glorious.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> following
passage in Lady Delier’s letter struck me particularly: “I&nbsp;neither
have read Amelia’s letter, nor has she read mine; however, if she has
been sincere, she will have wrote to you many fond things, as I can
guess by her grief at your departure, and by the warmth with which she
is animated when she speaks of you. I&nbsp;think that Amelia’s
resolution not to marry again will be dropt, as soon as the murderer of
her late Lord ceases to live, if not sooner. However, I&nbsp;would not
have you think that Amelia ever has mentioned any thing to that purpose,
or that I believe that a noble spotless soul like hers, could harbour
sentiments of revenge; but I suppose only that the amiable enthusiast
perhaps fancies that the ghost of her murdered Lord will not enjoy a
perfect tranquility and happiness, before the perpetrator of that
villainous deed has received the just reward of his atrocious crime.
Endeavour, my Lord, to settle your affairs at Mad**d as soon as
possible, in order to gladden our hearts by a speedy return.”</p>

<p>With regard to the latter point I wrote to Amelia: “My affairs make a
rapid and successful progress, and I shall soon see your Ladyship again.
See Amelia again! What happiness do these words imply! Heavens, how
great would my felicity be if I constantly could fix my eyes on the
loveliest of women! How superlatively happy should I be if I were
Amelia’s brother, in order that I could be constantly about her, and
speak to her: or her slave, that I could breathe under the same roof
with her, follow her every where, and anticipate every wink and every
wish of hers.”</p>

<p>I had been about three weeks at Mad**d when I visited the minister
one evening, and found him in company with a person who, by his dress,
appeared to be a man of rank. He seemed to be very old and infirm, but
conceive my astonishment, when, on approaching nearer, I&nbsp;fancied I
discerned the features of the Irishman, though every thing else was so
entirely changed, that he appeared to be quite a different person;
a&nbsp;wig covered his head, his dark eye-brows were changed into grey,
his complection yellowish, his voice weak, and frequently interrupted by
a hectic cough. The minister met me with the words: “My Lord Duke,
I&nbsp;have the honour to present to your Grace the Marchese Ricieri,
who lately is returned from a journey through your native country.” The
Marchese rose with difficulty, as it appeared, from his seat, and after
reciprocal civilities, and a short conversation, took his leave.</p>

<p>My looks followed him with astonishment to the anti-chamber, and I
found it extremely difficult to conceal my emotions from the minister,
who told me that the Marchese had brought bad news from Port***l, where
the spirit of sedition was said to be very busy. Not knowing how far I
durst disclose my thoughts on that
<span class = "pagenum">138b</span>
head without blundering upon the design of the Irishman, I&nbsp;returned
an indifferent answer, and endeavoured to turn the conversation to some
other object. Fortunately company was announced, I&nbsp;staid an hour
longer, and then took leave.</p>

<p>On my way to the hotel, somebody tapped me on the shoulder, and a
well-known voice said, “I&nbsp;am glad to see your Grace well.”
I&nbsp;turned round and the Irishman stood before me, dressed in black,
and wrapt in a scarlet cloak. I&nbsp;was seized with astonishment.
“I&nbsp;give you joy, my Lord;” said he in a friendly accent, “how do
your affairs go on?” “Extremely well!” I&nbsp;replied, adding after some
hesitation, “will you come with me to my hotel?” He accepted my
invitation.</p>

<p>“Be so kind,” said he when we were arrived at my apartment, “to take
care that we are not interrupted, nor over-heard!” This preamble made me
expect to hear important matters, and I was not deceived. Having
communicated to him how I had succeeded with Oliva*ez, and Suma*ez, he
approved my diligence and discretion, adding, “it is now time to come
nearer to the point. I&nbsp;am going to entrust you with two
commissions, both of which are equally important.”</p>

<p>“Let me hear what I am to do!”</p>

<p>“First of all you must endeavour to prompt the minister to publish a
royal edict, by which the Port****e nobility are ordered, under the
penalty of losing their estates, to enter into the military service of
Sp**n.”</p>

<p>“Good God, what do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Then,” he added, without noticing my exclamation, “you must advise
the minister to seize the person of the Duke of Brag**za.”</p>

<p>I flared at the Irishman, “Then the revolution is to be given up!”
said I, after a pause of anxious astonishment.</p>

<p>“Not at all, it rather is to be promoted by these means.”</p>

<p>“I cannot comprehend you;” I exclaimed, “you either are counteracting
your own plan; or the revolution will be destroyed in the bud.”</p>

<p>“My good Duke, one must frequently <i>appear</i> to counteract a plan
in order to carry it into execution with greater safety. I&nbsp;will
explain myself more distinctly.” So saying, he pushed his chair closer
to me, and continued in a lower accent; “Let us take a short view of the
situation of your country. Not to mention the enormous loss of its
possessions abroad, which it has suffered during the subjection to
Sp**n, the interior state of the empire is deplorable beyond
description. The King of Sp**n looks upon your country as a conquered
province, and takes the greatest pains to exhaust it entirely, in order
to keep it in inactivity with more ease; the royal revenues of Port***l
are either distributed among the favourites of the King, or mortgaged;
more than 300 gallies, and 2000 cannons have been carried to Sp**n; the
nobility are injured by the most unjust demands; the clergy must see
their benefices in the possession of foreigners; the people are beggared
by enormous
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page139" id = "page139">139</a></span>
taxes&mdash;in short matters have almost been carried to the highest
pitch. So much the better, for this is a sign that our undertaking is
ripe for execution. Let us strain the strings a little more, and they
must break.”</p>

<p>“And what then?” said I with ardour. “General commotion, and at the
same time universal confusion will be the consequence; and it is very
obvious that thus my country will not regain its liberty, but rather be
plunged in a more oppressive state of slavery. If the people are not
supported by the nobility, and both parties not united under one common
head, the furious unbridled populace will rage till the Sp**sh goads
shall have reduced them again to obedience.”</p>

<p>“You have divined my most secret thoughts,” the Irishman replied.
I&nbsp;was as if dropt from the clouds. “Then I have entirely
misconstrued your words,” I&nbsp;replied, “I&nbsp;am to endeavour to
obtain an edict in virtue of which, the Port****ze nobility are to be
bound to enter in the service of Sp**n, under the penalty of losing
their estates; I&nbsp;am to advise the minister to seize the Duke of
<span class = "locked">B&mdash;&mdash;a</span>! Did you not
say&nbsp;so?”</p>

<p>“Exactly so!”</p>

<p>“However, if the P---e nobility should enter into the Sp***sh
service, how are they to be active in the service of <i>their
country?</i> If the Duke of Bra***za should be seized, how will it be
possible that he should become the head of the conspirators?”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid your <i>ifs</i> should be realized!”</p>

<p>“But why the preparations for it? Indeed I do not comprehend
you.”</p>

<p>“You soon shall; only suffer me so go on. The people must be
supported by the accession of the nobility and clergy, and all parties
guided by a common leader; thus far you are perfectly right: and in
order to effect that purpose every preparation has been made, and the
general commotion will be effected in a harmonious and regular manner,
if <i>ever it can</i> be effected. But, dearest Duke, you look upon what
<i>may</i> happen as already existing. I&nbsp;was saying just now, that
matters have <i>almost</i> been carried to the highest pitch! one moment
of rashness may ruin the most prudent plan. It is true, that the people
and the clergy are waiting anxiously for the signal of a revolution;
however, the nobility are not sufficiently exasperated. Once already
have they been ordered to enter into the service of Sp**n against the
Cata**nians; however, they were satisfied to evince their displeasure
silently, by obeying the edict reluctantly and negligently. If in this
situation of affairs that edict should be renewed, and the transgressors
punished by the seizure of their estates, their resentment, which is
burning under the embers, will soon burst out into a blaze; then all the
states of the empire will be equally provoked, and it will be seasonable
for the Duke of Bra***za to give the signal for a general
commotion.”</p>

<p>“But is not this very Duke to be seized and imprisoned?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">139b</span>
<p>“Neither is he to be seized, nor are the Port****ze nobility to enter
into the Sp**sh service, but both parties are to be provoked, by the
severest oppression, in such a manner that their resentment may break
out into open revolt.”</p>

<p>“His father would not have wanted such a violent incitement; the Duke
has, however, inherited very little of the spirit of his parent<a class
= "plain" name = "tag139" id = "tag139" href = "#note139">*</a>.”</p>

<p>“A rash resolution is not always the firmest, nor is a precipitate
deed always the best. And besides, the undertaking of the Duke of
Bra***za is of such a nature, that he risks nothing less than his own
and his family’s welfare; it requires therefore a more mature
consideration<ins class = "correction"

<p>“But if he should flinch back!”</p>

the execution of the second commission which I have given you.”</p>

The Grandmother of the Duke of Brag**za had already attempted to enforce
her claim to the throne; she was, however, obliged to yield to superior
power. His father was hurt so much at the loss of the crown, that he had
formed the design to seize the King of Sp**n when he stopped at his
palace at Vi**ciosa, on his journey to Li*bon, and not to set him at
liberty till he should have renounced to him the crown of Por***al. His
friends represented to him how impossible it would be to accomplish this
design; however, he could not be persuaded to desist from all farther
attempts of getting possession of the sceptre of Port***al, and his
people were frequently instigated by him to quarrel with the King’s
Officers at Li*bon, on which occasion the populace evinced clearly how
strong their attachment to the family of Bra***za was. But matters were
never pushed any farther, the proper time when the crown of Por***al,
should be restored to its lawful possessors being not yet arrived. The
old Duke was so much grieved at his unsuccessful attempt, that at length
his reason was disordered. He spoke constantly of war and arms, and
ordered his family, on his death-bed, to bury him with Royal pomp, which
was actually done, though in secret.</p>

vegetables and minerals dispersed in the four quarters of the globe.

<h4>REMARKS ON MUSIC.</h4>

<p class = "center smaller">
(Continued from <a href = "#page124">page 124</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Some</span> Historians
affirm that music was first known in Egypt, and by comparing the
accounts of <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for Diodorus">Didorus</ins> Siculus, and of Plato, there is reason to
suppose, that in very ancient times the study of music in Egypt, was
confined to the Priesthood, who used it only on religious and solemn
occasions; that, as well as sculpture, it was circumscribed by law: that
it was esteemed sacred, and forbidden to be <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘mployed’">employed</ins> on light or common
occasions; and that innovation in it was prohibited; but what the style
or relative excellence of this very ancient music was, there are no
traces by which we can form any accurate judgment. After the reigns of
the Pharoahs, the Egyptians fell by turns under the dominion of the
Ethiopians, the Persians, the Greeks, and the Romans. By such
revolutions, the manners and amusements of the people, as well as their
form of government, must have been changed. In the age of the Ptolemies,
the musical games and contests instituted by these monarchs were of
Greek origin, and the musicians who performed were chiefly Greeks. The
most ancient monuments of human art and industry, at present extant at
Rome, are the obelisks brought there from Egypt, two of which are said
to have been erected by Sesostris at Heliopolis, about 400 years before
the siege of Troy. These were by the order of Augustus brought to Rome
after the conquest of Egypt. One of them called <i>guglia rotta</i>, or
the broken pillar, which during the sacking of the City in 1527 was
thrown down and broke, still lays in the Campus Martius. On it is seen
the figure of a musical instrument of two strings and with a neck. It
resembles much the calascione still used in the kingdom of Naples.</p>

<p>This curious relict of antiquity is mentioned, because it affords
better evidence than, on the subject of ancient music, is usually to be
met with, that the Egyptians at so very early a period of their history,
had advanced to a considerable degree of excellence in the cultivation
of the arts. By means of its neck, this instrument was capable, with
only two strings, of producing a great number of notes.</p>

<p>These two strings if tuned fourths to each other, would furnish that
series of sounds which the ancients call <i>heptichord</i>, which
consist of a conjunct tetrachord as B. C. D. E; E. F. G. A; if tuned in
fifths; they would produce an octave, or two disjunct tetrachords. The
annals of no other nation than Egypt, for many ages after the period of
the obelisk at Heliopolis, exhibit the vestige of any contrivance to
shorten strings during performance by a neck or finger board. Father
Montfaucon observes, that after examining 500 ancient lyres, harps, and
citheras, he could discover no such thing.</p>

Thou too in the morning of thy days wast amiable. But when thou hadst

then thou didst imbibe the vices of the age. As the flower lost its
crimson hue, thou wast fast losing thy hold of virtue. And as the rose
had entirely faded, so rectitude, integrity, innocence, and every
amiable virtue became strangers to thy heart; and left thee, entirely,

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Lodoiska</span> uttered the
most dreadful groans, to which I answered by cries of fury. Boleslas
rushed from one part of the prison to another, like a madman; he sent
forth the most terrible howlings; he attempted to burst open the door
with his hands and feet. As for myself, I&nbsp;remained at the window,
and shook, amidst my transports of fury, those massive iron-bars which I
was unable to bend.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, the domestics, who had lately mounted the
battlements, descend with precipitation, and open the gates: we heard
the voice of Dourlinski himself, begging for quarter. The victors
instantly precipitate themselves amidst the flames; and being at length
attracted by our cries, they force open the door of our prison with
their hatchets.</p>

<p>By their dress and their arms, I know them to be Tartars: their chief
arrives&mdash;&mdash;it is Titsikan!</p>

<p>“Ah! ah!” exclaims he; “it is my brave friend!”</p>

<p>I instantly throw myself on his
neck:&mdash;“Titsikan!&mdash;&mdash;Lodoiska!&mdash;&mdash;a
lady!&mdash;&mdash;the fairest of women!&mdash;&mdash;in that
tower!&mdash;&mdash;about to be burnt alive!”</p>

<p>These were the incoherent expressions by which I made my feelings
known.</p>

<p>The Tartar instantly gives the word of command to his
followers&mdash;&mdash;they fly to the tower<span class =

near to an old pillar we discover a narrow, winding stair-case, filled
with smoke.</p>

<p>The Tartars, affrighted at the danger, start back: I prepare to
ascend.</p>

<p>“Alas! what are you about?” exclaims Boleslas.</p>

<p>“To live or die with Lodoiska!”</p>

<p>“And I will either live or die with my master!” was the reply of my
generous servant.</p>

<p>I rush on---he follows me! At the risk of suffocation, we ascend
about forty steps; by the light of the flames we discover Lodoiska in a
corner of her prison; who feebly utters; “Who is it that
approaches&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“It is Lovzinski! it is your lover!”</p>

<p>Joy instantly lends her new strength; she rises and flies into my
arms: we carry her away; we descend a few steps; but volumes of smoke
now fill all the stair-case, and we are forced to re-ascend with
precipitation. At that very instant, too, a&nbsp;part of the tower gives
way!<span class = "locked">---</span>Boleslas utters a dreadful shriek,
and Lodoiska falls into a swoon.</p>

<p>That which was on the point of destroying, saved us! The flames,

was dissipated.<span class = "locked">---</span>Laden with our precious
burden, Boleslas and I descend in haste<span class =

of the tower; Titsikan, trembling for our safety, was expecting us
there: “Brave men!”<span class = "locked">---</span>exclaimed he, on
seeing us appear again.&mdash;&mdash;I place Lodoiska at his feet, and
fall down lifeless by her side!</p>

<p>I remained nearly an hour in this situation. They tremble for my
life; and Boleslas weeps aloud. I&nbsp;again recover my senses, on
hearing the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘vioce’">voice</ins> of Lodoiska, who, returning to herself, calls me
her deliverer. The appearance of every thing was altered; the tower was
entirely in ruins. The Tartars, however, had stopt the progress of the
flames; they had destroyed one part of the castle, on purpose to save
the remainder; in fine, we had been carried into a large saloon, where
we were surrounded by Titsikan and some of his soldiers. Others of them
were occupied in pillaging and in bringing away the gold, silver,
jewels, plate, and all the precious effects which the flames had
spared.</p>

<p>Near to us Dourlinski, loaded with fetters, and uttering repeated
groans, beheld this heap of riches, of which, he was about to be
despoiled. Rage, terror, despair, all the passions which can tear the
heart of a villain suffering under punishment, were visibly depicted in
his wild and wandering looks. He struck the earth with <ins class =
"correction" title = ", missing">fury,</ins> dashed his clenched hands
against his forehead, and, uttering the most horrible blasphemies, he
reproached Heaven for its just vengeance.</p>

<p>In the mean time, my lovely mistress holds my hand clasped in hers.
“Alas,” says she at length, with tears in her eyes, “alas! you have
saved my life, and your own is still in danger! Nay, even if we escape
death, slavery awaits&nbsp;us!”</p>

<p>“No, no, Lodoiska, be comforted, Titsikan is not my enemy; Titsikan
will put a period to our misfortunes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, if I am able,” exclaims the Tartar, interrupting me:
“you are in the right, brave man! (adds&nbsp;he) I&nbsp;see that you are
not dead, and I am happy: you always say, and do good things; and you
have there (turning to Boleslas), you have there a friend who seconds
you admirably.”</p>

<p>On this I embrace Boleslas:&mdash;“yes, Titsikan, yes, I have a
friend, who shall always be dear to&nbsp;me!&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Tartar again interrupts me: “What! were not you both confined in
an apartment below ground, and was not this lady in a tower? What was
the reason of that? I&nbsp;will lay any wager, continues he with a
smile, that you have taken this female from that old wretch, (pointing
to Dourlinski), and you are in the right; for he is a dotard, and she is
beautiful! Come&mdash;inform me of every thing.”</p>

<p>I now discover my own name to Titsikan, that of Lodoiska’s father,
and every particular that had occurred to me until that moment. It
belongs to Lodoiska, I&nbsp;observe in conclusion, to make us acquainted
with what she has been obliged to suffer from the infamous Dourlinski,
ever since she has been in his castle!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page142" id = "page142">142</a></span>
<p>“You know,” replies Lodoiska, “that my father me to leave Warsaw, on
the day that the diet was opened. He first conducted me to the
territories of the Palatine of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, at only
twenty leagues distance from the capital, to which he returned, on
purpose to assist at the meeting of the states.</p>

<p>“On that very day when M. de P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was proclaimed
king, Pulaski took me from the castle of the palatine, and conducted me
here, thinking that I should be better concealed. He charged Dourlinski
to guard me with extraordinary strictness; and, above all things, to
take especial care to prevent Lovzinski from discovering the place of my
retreat. He then left me, as he informed me, on purpose to assemble and
encourage the good citizens to defend his country, and to punish
traitors. Alas! these important avocations have made him forget his
daughter, for I have never seen him since.</p>

<p>“A few days after his departure, I began to perceive that the visits
of Dourlinski had become more frequent than usual; in a short time, he
hardly ever quitted the apartment assigned me for a prison. He deprived
me, under some trifling pretext, of the only female attendant whom my
father had left me; and to prevent any person (as he said) from knowing
that I was in his castle, he himself brought me the food necessary for
my subsistence, and passed whole days along with me. You cannot
conceive, my dear Lovzinski, how much I suffered from the continual
presence of a man who was odious to me, and whose infamous designs I was
suspicious of: he even dared to explain himself to me one day: but I
assured him that my hate should always be the price of his tenderness,
and that his unworthy conduct had drawn upon him my sovereign
contempt.</p>

<p>“He answered me coldly, that in time I should accustom myself to see
him, and to suffer his assiduities; nay, he did not in the least alter
his usual conduct, for he entered my chamber in the morning, and never
retired until night. Separated from all I loved, I&nbsp;had not even the
feeble consolation of being able to enjoy the sweet recollection of past
happiness. A&nbsp;witness to my misfortunes, Dourlinski took pleasure in
augmenting them.</p>

<p>“‘Pulaski,’ says he to me, ‘commands a body of Polish troops;
Lovzinski betraying his country, which he does not love, and a woman
concerning whom he is indifferent, serves in the Russian army, where he
will be cut off during some bloody engagement: besides, if he survives,
it is evident that nothing can ever reconcile your father to him.’</p>

<p>“A few days after, he came on purpose to announce to me, that
Pulaski, during the night, had attacked the Russians in their camp; and
that, amidst the confusion that ensued, my lover had fallen by the hand
of my father. The cruel Palatine even made me read a narrative of this
event, drawn up with every appearance of truth, in a kind of public
gazette, which doubtless he had procured to be printed expressly for the
purpose:
<span class = "pagenum">142b</span>
besides, on perceiving the barbarous joy which he affected on this
occasion, I&nbsp;thought the news but too true.</p>

<p>“Pitiless tyrant! cried I, you enjoy my tears and my despair; but
cease to persecute me, or you will soon see that the daughter of Pulaski
is herself able to avenge her own injuries!</p>

<p>“One evening that he had left me sooner than usual, after I retired
to bed, I&nbsp;heard my door open very softly. By the light of a lamp,
which I kept always burning, I&nbsp;beheld my tyrant advancing towards
my bed. As there was no crime of which I did not believe him to be
capable, I&nbsp;had foreseen this event; and I had even taken measures
to render it unsuccessful. I&nbsp;accordingly armed myself with a long
sharp knife, which I had the precaution to conceal beneath my pillow;
I&nbsp;overwhelmed the wretch with the reproaches which he so justly
merited; and I vowed, if he dared to advance, that I would poniard him
with my own hand.</p>

<p>“He retired, with surprise and affright visibly delineated on his
countenance: ‘I&nbsp;am tired,’ said he as he went out, ‘with
experiencing nothing but scorn; and if I were not afraid of being
overheard, you should soon perceive what a woman’s arm could effect
against mine! But I know a way of vanquishing your pride! By and by you
will think yourself but too happy in being able to purchase your pardon,
by the most humiliating submissions.’</p>

<p>“He now withdrew. A few moments after, his confident entered with a
pistol in his hand. I&nbsp;must, however, do him the justice to say,
that he wept while he announced to me the orders of his lord.</p>

<p>“‘Dress yourself, Madam; you must instantly follow me!’&mdash;This
was all that he was able to say to&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>“He then conducted me to that very tower, where, without you,
I&nbsp;should this morning have perished: he shut me up in that horrible
prison; it was there that I had languished for more than a month,
without fire, without the light of heaven, and almost without <ins class

for my food; for my bed a few trusses of straw: this was the deplorable
state to which the only daughter of a grandee of Poland was reduced!</p>

<p>“You shudder, brave stranger, and yet believe me, when I assure you,
that I do not recount to you any more than a small part of my
sufferings. One thing, however, rendered my misery less insupportable:
I&nbsp;no longer beheld my tyrant. While he expected with tranquility
that I should solicit my pardon, I&nbsp;passed whole days and nights in
calling on the name of my father, and in bewailing my lover!<span class

<p class = "center smallcaps">An Anecdote.</p>

<hr class = "w04">

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Among</span> words which in
their present acceptation are remote from their original and rigid
meaning, none perhaps are more striking than Deism and Freethinking. The
former, which in its strict import signifies nothing more than a belief
in the existence of the Deity, in opposition to Atheism (and in this
sense every christian is a Deist) is now universally understood of all
persons who reject the christian revelation; and the word Freethinking,
which should convey the idea of a man of liberal and ingenuous
disposition, free from vulgar prejudice and unmanly bigotry, and
investigating truth with virtuous view, and a deep veneration of the
Supreme Being, is now commonly appropriated to those persons, who from a
love of singularity, an affectation of superior understanding, or innate
malignity of mind, would combat truths the most universally received and
revered in all ages and in all countries, and would dissolve those
sacred ties by which society is united, and destroy those hopes of
immortality which God hath given as incentives to virtue, and the best
security of our happiness here and hereafter.</p>

<p>The conduct of the Freethinker, whether actuated by such motives or
not, is replete with extreme folly, to give it no harsher appellation.
An anecdote of the late Mr. Mallet affords a remarkable instance of the
truth of this observation, and cannot fail to convey some useful advice.
This gentleman was a great Freethinker, and a very free speaker of his
free thoughts. He made no scruple to disseminate his opinions wherever
he could introduce them. At his own table, the lady of the house (who
was a staunch advocate for her husband’s opinions) would often in the
warmth of argument, say, ‘Sir, we Deists.’ The lecture upon the non
credenda of the Freethinkers was repeated so often, and urged with so
much earnestness, that the inferior domestics became soon as able
disputants as the heads of the family. The fellow who waited at the
table being thoroughly convinced, that for any of his misdeeds he should
have no after account to make, was resolved to profit by the doctrine,
and made off with many things of value, particularly the plate. Luckily
he was so closely pursued, that he was brought back with his prey to his
master’s house, who examined him before some select friends. At first,
the man was sullen, and would answer no questions; but, being urged to
give a reason for his infamous behaviour he resolutely said, ‘Sir,
I&nbsp;had heard you so often talk of the impossibility of a future
state, and that after death there was no reward for virtue, or
punishment for vice, that I was tempted to commit the robbery.’ ‘Well;
but you rascal,’ replied Mallet, ‘had you no fear of the gallows?’
‘Sir,’ said the fellow, looking sternly at his master, ‘what is that to
you, if I had a mind to venture that? You had removed my greatest
terror; why should I fear the least?’</p>

<h4>AN ESSAY ON HOPE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">There</span> is, perhaps,
no word in our language more generally understood than the term <span
class = "smallcaps">Hope</span>. The idea represented by this word is so
well known from its pleasing effects on the mind, and so
indiscriminately experienced in one or other of its degrees, that any
explanation of it seems to be unnecessary. All know that Hope signifies
an expectation indulged with pleasure.</p>

<p>In all the works of Nature we can find no two objects exactly
similar. The surprising diversity proceeds from a degree almost
imperceptible, by a slow gradation, down to direct opposition in the
minutest circumstances; so that in the amazing variety, we can find no
object, whether of sense or imagination, which has not its direct
reverse.</p>

<p>With respect to the sensations of the mind, I know none more directly
contrasted than that expressed by the word Hope. Its reverse is Fear.
And though Love and Hatred&mdash;Joy and Sorrow&mdash;Light and Darkness
are not more opposed to each other than those two passions; yet it will
appear a little remarkable, that they not only spring from the same
source, but are <i>really</i> and <i>identically</i> the same in some of
the original steps or gradations. The same passion or power of the mind
varies its name in the different stages of its advancement. Every thing
has its state of infancy. In their pristine state, Hope and Fear are
both called Esteem. This may be termed the <i>infant state</i> of
attachment to any object. Esteem soon advances to its second stage, in
which it takes the name of Love. In a third gradation it is called
Desire; Love ever produces the desire of enjoyment. Those are the
original and <i>common</i> steps of Hope and fear; nor is there yet any
sort of distinction either with respect to <i>object</i> or
<i>sensation</i>: but here the difference begins.&mdash;They are no
longer the same. The strong dissimilarity of different minds may render
the subsequent stages of operation as different as contradiction itself.
Mark the progression of Desire in two minds of different textures. Let
us suppose the object the same. Let us suppose it Riches; or (if that
will animate the idea) a&nbsp;person of a different sex. In the one mind
Desire improves to Hope; in the other it degenerates to fear. In the one
instance,
<span class = "pagenum">145b</span>
Hope advances to a state of superior sensation, which we term Joy; in
the other, fear sinks down the rugged declivity to that dreary region
called despair.</p>

<p>Thus one man looks with pleasure and fortitude beyond his present
difficulties; and though his hopes, in some instances, may be decidedly
blasted, what then? he never anticipated the disappointment, nor will
the happy turn of his mind permit him to indulge its vexations. His
active passions soon find another object of exercise and pursuit. Very
frequently he gains the summit of felicity in the enjoyment of his
favourite object; and still he has the <i>independent</i> happiness
arising from the constant exercise of Hope. A&nbsp;person of the above
description is never heard to complain of this <i>troublesome, woeful,
sinful world</i>; he has no such bad opinion of life in general, as
promotes a desire of quitting it; or of going to another, to avoid the
disappointments of this<span class = "locked">---</span>the common
source of all such wishes. No: he acts his part as a man; enjoys life as
man was designed to do; contributes to the happiness of all around him,
and secures his own.</p>

<p>Let us now take a slight view of the other side of the picture<span
class = "locked">---</span>the man of an opposite cast. We left him in
despair of possession; he yields his cowardly heart a victim to the
vulture; and, if his distress is not somewhat alleviated by transferring
his attention to some other object, he either abridges his life with a
pistol or halter, or drags along a miserable existence indeed. These are
no exaggerated or imaginary ideas.<span class = "locked">---</span>This
is reason, truth, fact<span class = "locked">---</span>Human Nature.</p>

<p>The above simple remarks may convince us, that the same passions are
very different (in point of degree) in different persons. What
predominates in one, is counteracted and overpowered in another; and men
are happy or otherwise, as Hope or Fear happens to be the most powerful
passion.</p>

<p>Those to whom the important charge of education is committed, may
perhaps draw some useful inferences from the above observations. It is
much in their power (if calculated for the serious business) to
suppress, to a proper degree, any abstract passion of an unhappy
tendency, whether in itself or its consequences.</p>

understand this?”</p>

<p>“You think this measure would be too harsh and violent, however it is
not a mere arbitrary artifice, but adapted to the situation in which the
Duke of Bra***za is at present. The minister of Sp**n is not ignorant of
the fermentations in Po****al, and suspecting the Duke to be the chief
source of them, his principal attention is directed to him.&mdash;But
what could Oliva*ez have attempted against him as yet? Open force would
have been fruitless, and not only forwarded the general revolt, but also
justified the actions of the Duke. He was therefore forced to have
recourse to art. At first he conferred the government of Mi*an upon the
Duke, in order to have an opportunity of getting him in his power;
however that keen-sighted nobleman declined that honour, pretending not
to have sufficient knowledge of the country to acquit himself honourably
of a trust of so much importance. Soon after the minister found another
opportunity of laying a new snare. The King of Sp**n having resolved to
chastise the rebellious Catal*nians in person, the Duke was very civilly
invited to accompany him in the field; but he begged to be excused,
alledging that this would be attended with great expences, and that his
finances were very low. However Oliva**z was not discouraged by this
refusal, and has lately made a third attempt. A&nbsp;rumour having been
spread all over the country, that a Fren*h fleet was approaching the
coasts of Po****al, probably with a view to make a descent, Oliva**z
conferred upon the Duke an almost unlimited power to make the requisite
preparations against the impending invasion, and particularly to review
all the ports, to fortify and to garrison them. Meanwhile the Sp**ish
Admiral, Don Lopez Oz**co had received secret orders to carry his fleet
to a port where the Duke should be, to invite him to review it, and when
he should have seized him, to sail with his prisoner to Sp**n. This plan
was however rendered abortive by a dreadful storm which dispersed the
fleet, and forced the Admiral to desist from his design of visiting the
Port****ze ports. No new attempt has been made since, and the minister
is silently hatching other artifices. Yet this calm is, without
comparison, more dreadful than all the attempts which have been made.
I&nbsp;know that he has an emissary in Por***al, who watches secretly
every step of the Duke,<a class = "plain" name = "tag146" id = "tag146"
href = "#note146">*</a> whose liberty and life are in imminent danger.
The ruin of the head of the conspiracy would be a mortal blow to the
whole revolutionary society; even the imprisonment of the Duke would
unnerve the hands of the conspirators. If, therefore, the revolution is
to take place, the Duke must be secured against the secret machinations
of the minister; I&nbsp;say the <i>secret</i>
<span class = "pagenum">146b</span>
machinations, for if they should be carried on publicly, as it has been
the case as yet, his snares may easily be evaded. For which reason it
will be matter of great importance to persuade the minister to carry on
his attempts in the usual way, and to effect this will be in your power.
Nay, you yourself must frame and direct the designs upon the Duke.”</p>

<p>“I fear,” said I to the Irishman, “you expect more from my feeble
exertions than I shall be able to perform.”</p>

<p>“Hear first my plan! You are to go, the day after tomorrow, to
Oliva*ez, and to inform him that you have received intelligence of the
commotions in Por***al&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Besides,” I interrupted him, “Oliva*ez has told me to-day that he
has received an account of these commotions from a certain Marchese
Ricieri, who is returned from his travels through Por***al.”</p>

<p>“So much the better!” he replied, without returning my inquisitive
look, or changing his countenance at the name of Ricieri, “so much the
better! then you have a prefacer to whose introduction you can link your
discourse. Tell, therefore, the minister, that the letter which you have
received from Por***al makes it very plain to you, why the Duke had
declined all the invitations which the court had given him. Oliva*ez
will request you to explain these words, and then you must reply, that
you suspect the Duke of Brag**za to avoid the neighbourhood of the
Court, because he is sensible he has deserved the resentment of the King
by his disloyalty. At the same time you must add, that you are very
sorry to be obliged to declare against so near a relation as the Duke;
that, however, the voice of your conscience has more weight with you
than that of consanguinity, and that your allegiance to the King of
Sp**n and your country, which has been reduced to the greatest distress
by the constant internal commotions, does not suffer you any longer to
regard as a friend, the man who was the chief cause of all these
troubles. Thus you will gain the confidence of the minister, and he will
ask you what measures for seizing the Duke you think would be most
proper and safe. Take hold of that opportunity to convince the minister
that, and for what reason, violent measures of any kind, would produce
the worst consequences. Approve of the means which the wisdom of his
policy has already adopted as the safest, by which the Duke ought to be
persecuted till no farther evasion should be left for him. Oliva*ez will
desire you to give him your opinion more at large, and then you must
address him to the following purpose:&mdash;‘I am of opinion that you
ought to inform the Duke of the misfortune which has befallen the fleet,
and to charge him, under the pretext that this had rendered the
situation of the empire very perilous, with the commission to inspect
all the strong places of the kingdom, and to fortify them where he shall
think it requisite. At the same time you will do well to order all the
commanders of the fortified towns to seize the Duke as secretly as
possible. In order to prevent any
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page147" id = "page147">147</a></span>
evasions under the pretext of want of money, you must send him, at the
same time, a&nbsp;sum sufficient for defraying the expences of his
journey.”</p>

<p>“But suppose,” said I, “this proposal should be accepted, how could
the Duke of Brag**za escape the snare?”</p>

<p>“Can we not apprize him of his danger? If he cannot find means to
escape the snare by dint of art, he must have recourse to open force,
and call to arms. Thus the revolution will begin, and our chief aim be
attained.”</p>

<p>“One can predict,” the Irishman continued, “with some degree of
certainty, that Oliva*ez will not reject that proposal, which is nothing
but a continuation of his former plan, and of course, will flatter his
conceit. As soon as you shall have carried this point, you must
endeavour to effect the promulgation of the edict against the nobility;
which will be no difficult task, if you pretend to have been informed by
letters from Por***al, that the major part of the nobility is entirely
devoted to the Duke, and will support him if a revolt should break
out.&mdash;Hence you may draw the conclusion that the fermentation in
Por***al will never cease, and the wisest measures against him, though
ever so successful, will not have the desired effect, while the nobility
shall not be employed somewhere else, and forced to submit to the edict
by which they are ordered to enter into the service of Sp**n.
I&nbsp;advise you, at the same time, to add, that the indulgence which
has been shewn to those who have refused to obey the proclamation of the
Court, will render the nobility more daring, and the Duke of Brag**za
more dangerous. In short, you must exert every power of persuasion to
incite the minister to renew and to enforce that edict.”</p>

<p>After a short pause the Irishman added:&mdash;“This advice would
appear suspicious, if proposed by any other person but yourself. You
have gained, already, his confidence to such a degree, that it will
derive additional strength from your apparent zeal. And indeed every
thing that can contribute to remove all traces of suspicion from you
concurs in your person! The proposals which you are to make have not
only the appearance of destroying the design of the Duke and the
conspirators, but you have also been on your travels when they were
fabricated, and of course, cannot be suspected of having the least share
in them. While you have been here your time has been spent in amusements
and diversions, how could you, therefore, be supposed to have been
capable of paying any attention to deep laid intrigues of state? On the
contrary, the minister is no stranger to your father’s fidelity to the
King of Sp**n, and to the secret hatred which your family harbours
against the Duke of Brag**za; how could, therefore, your proposal appear
to him otherwise than natural and sincere? Your friendship for Velas*os
alone would be sufficient to make him believe so.”</p>

<p>“I need not remind you,” added the Irishman, when he was going to
leave me, “not to forget to interest the Secretary of State, Suma*ez,
for your transactions.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">147b</span>
<p>“But suppose,” I replied, “I should acquit myself of my charge to
your satisfaction, how am I to conceal the matter from my father?”</p>

<p>The Irishman replied after a momentary consideration: “If the
minister should approve your proposals, you must request him frankly not
to mention any thing to the Marquis, pretending to intend to surprise
him in an agreeable manner, by an oral account, when the whole affair
shall <ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘he’">be</ins> happily
concluded.”</p>

<p>Before he took leave, he enjoined me to be circumspect, courageous,
and active.</p>

<p>I cannot say whether it was owing to the execution of this advice, to
the facility of the task, or to favourable accidents, that I carried my
point without difficulty. The minister approved my plan; the Duke of
<span class = "locked">B&mdash;&mdash;a</span> received the above
mentioned order along with 40,000 ducats, and the edict concerning the
nobility was renewed. However, the Duke of <span class =
"locked">B&mdash;&mdash;a</span> again escaped the snare. He did,
indeed, execute the orders of the Sp***sh court, travelled all over
P****l, and observed every where how the people were devoted to him; the
money he had received, and the power that was entrusted to him, enabled
him to gain many friends, and he entered the fortified towns so well
escorted, that none of the Sp***sh governors dared seize him.</p>

<p>The Irishman who gave me this information, provided me at the same
time with instructions how to act if the minister should complain of the
miscarriage of my plan, which soon happened. Oliva*ez acquainted me very
peevishly, with the bad success of our undertaking. “We may yet carry
our point,” I&nbsp;replied, after some reflection, with seeming
unconcern. “If you wish to pursue your plan, you may easily lay a new
snare for him, from which the Duke will not be able to extricate
himself. You have the best opportunity of sending him an order to repair
to Mad**d, and to make to his Majesty an oral report of the state of
Port**l.”</p>

<p>The minister approved of this advice, and carried it into execution
without delay. The Duke of <span class =
"locked">B&mdash;&mdash;a</span>, who was well aware that the order from
the Sp***sh court could not be declined any longer, sent his Chamberlain
to Mad**d in order to hire a palace, to engage a number of servants, and
to make every preparation for his pretended arrival, but nevertheless
did not come. One time he pleaded ill health, at another time want of
money; and at last, wished to know what rank he was to hold at Mad**d.
However, I&nbsp;was so fortunate as to guide the minister in such a
manner that every obstacle was removed at last, and the Duke received
6000 ducats for defraying the expences of his journey.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the Irishman to me, “the Duke will find it impossible to
shift any longer, and either must repair to Mad**d, which he will take
care not to do, or give the signal for the revolution. Your business, my
Lord, is finished, and nothing further will be required of you than the
strictest secrecy. When your country will be free, we shall meet again,
and then you may expect to see all my promises accomplished.”</p>

<hr class = "w075">

<p class = "center smallcaps">From The Tatler.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I fell</span> in the other
evening with a party who were engaged in examining which was the
handsomest style of addressing the Fair, and writing Letters of
Gallantry.&mdash;Many were the opinions immediately declared on this
subject: Some were for a certain softness; some for I know not what of
delicacy; others for something inexpressibly tender: When it came to me,
I&nbsp;said there was no rule in the world to be made for writing
Letters, but that of being as near what you speak face to face as you
can; which is so great a truth, that I am of opinion, writing has lost
more Mistresses than any one mistake in the whole legend of Love. For
when you write to a Lady for whom you have a solid and honourable Love,
the great idea you have of her, joined to a quick sense of her absence,
fills your mind with a sort of tenderness, that gives your language too
much the air of complaint, which is seldom successful. For a man may
flatter himself as he pleases, but he will find, that the women have
more understanding in their own affairs than we have, and women of
spirit are not to be won by mourners.&mdash;Therefore he that can keep
handsomely within rules, and support the carriage of a companion to his
mistress, is much more likely to prevail, than he who lets her see the
whole relish of his life depends upon her. If possible therefore, divert
your mistress, rather than sigh to her. The pleasant man she will desire
for her own sake; but the languishing lover has nothing to hope for but
her pity. To shew the difference I produced two Letters a Lady gave me,
which had been writ to her by two gentlemen who made love to her, but
were both killed the day after the date at the battle of <i>Almanza</i>.
One of them was a mercurial gay-humoured man; the other a man of a
serious but a great and gallant spirit. Poor <i>Jack Careless!</i> This
is his letter: You see how it is folded: The air of it is so negligent,
one might have read half of it by peeping into it, without breaking it
open. He had no exactness.</p>

<p class = "inset"><i>MADAM</i>,</p>

<p>‘It is a very pleasant circumstance I am in, that while I should be
thinking of the good company we are to meet within a day or two, where
we shall go to loggerheads, my thoughts are running upon a Fair Enemy in
<i>England</i>. I was in hopes I had left you there; but you follow the
camp, tho’ I&nbsp;have endeavoured to make some of our leaguer Ladies
drive you out of the Field. All my comfort is, you are more troublesome
to my Colonel than myself: I&nbsp;permit you to visit me only now and
then; but he downright keeps you. I&nbsp;laugh at his honour as far as
his gravity will allow me; But I know him to be a man of too much merit
to succeed with a woman. Therefore defend your heart as well as you can,
I&nbsp;shall come home this winter irresistibly dressed, and with quite
a new foreign air. And so, I&nbsp;had like to say, I&nbsp;rest, but
alas! I&nbsp;remain, <i>Madam</i>,</p>

<p class = "center"><i>Your most Obedient, Most Humble Servant</i>,</p>

<p class = "right smallcaps">John Careless.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">148b</span>
<p>Now for Colonel <i>Constant’s</i> Epistle; you see it is folded and
directed with the utmost care.</p>

<p class = "inset"><i>MADAM</i>,</p>

<p>‘<span class = "firstword">I do</span> myself the honour to write to
you this evening because I believe to-morrow will be a day of battle,
and something forebodes in my breast that I shall fall in it. If it
proves so, I&nbsp;hope you will hear I have done nothing below a man who
had a love of his country, quickened by a passion for a woman of honour.
If there be any thing noble in going to a certain death; if there be any
merit, I&nbsp;meet it with pleasure, by promising myself a place in your
esteem; if your applause, when I am no more, is preferable to the most
glorious life without you; I&nbsp;say, Madam, if any of these
considerations can have weight with you, you will give me a kind place
in your memory, which I prefer to the glory of <i>Cæsar</i>. I hope,
this will be read, as it is writ, with tears.’</p>

<p>The beloved Lady is a woman of a sensible mind; but she has confessed
to me, that after all her true and solid value for <i>Constant</i>, she
had much more concern for the loss of <i>Careless</i>. Those great and
serious spirits have something equal to the adversities they meet with,
and consequently lessen the objects of pity. Great accidents seem not
cut out so much for men of familiar characters, which makes them more
easily pitied, and soon after beloved. Add to this, that the sort of
love which generally succeeds, is a stranger to awe and distance.
I&nbsp;asked <i>Romana</i>, whether of the two she should have chosen
had they survived? She said, She knew she ought to have taken
<i>Constant</i>; but believed, she should have chosen
<i>Careless</i>.</p>

(Continued from <a href = "#page142">page 142</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Titsikan</span> was
listening to the story of our misfortunes, with which he appeared to be
deeply affected, when one of his centinels approached, and sounded an
alarm. He immediately left us in great haste, on purpose to run to the
drawbridge. We heard a great tumult, and began already to presage some
inauspicious event.</p>

<p>While we remained plunged in consternation,---“Lovzinski, Lodoiska,
cowardly and perfidious pair!” exclaims Dourlinski, unable to contain
his joy<span class = "locked">---</span>“you have hoped to be able to
elude my vengeance, and escape my chastisement. Tremble! you are once
more about to fall into my hands. At the noise of my captivity and
misfortunes, the neighbouring nobility are undoubtedly assembled, and
have now come to succour&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“---They can only revenge you, villain!” cries Boleslas, interrupting
him in the midst of his threats, and seizing, at the same time, an iron
bar, with which he prepared to knock him down; I, however, instantly
interposed and prevented him from executing this act of justice.</p>

<p>Titsikan returned in a few minutes: “It is only a false alarm,” said
he to us; “it is nothing more than a small detachment which I dispatched
yesterday, on purpose to scour the country<span class =
"locked">---</span>they had orders to rejoin me here; and they have
brought me some prisoners: every thing is quiet, and the neighbourhood
does not appear to be in the least commotion.”</p>

<p>While Titsikan yet spoke to me, a number of unfortunates, whose
luckless fate had delivered them into the hands of the enemy, were
dragged before him. We first beheld five, who, being unbound, walked by
the side of their conquerors, with a downcast and melancholy aspect. The
Tartars told us, that one of their companions had been overcome with
great difficulty, and that was the reason why he was bound hand and
foot!</p>

<p>The sixth now appeared<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ::">: </ins>“O Heavens! it is my father!” exclaims Lodoiska, running at
the same time towards him.<span class = "locked">---</span>I, too, threw
myself at the feet of Pulaski. “Are you Pulaski?” says the Tartar
chieftain, “’tis well; the event is lucky! Believe me, my friend, it is
not more than a quarter of an hour since I first heard of you.
I&nbsp;know however, that you are proud and hot-headed, but no matter!
I&nbsp;esteem you; you possess both courage and abilities; your daughter
is beautiful, and does not want for understanding; Lovzinski is
brave<span class = "locked">---</span>braver than myself, as I have
already experienced. Attend to what I am about to say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Pulaski, motionless with astonishment, scarcely heard the sound of
the Tartar’s voice; and struck, at the same
<span class = "pagenum">149b</span>
time, with the strange spectacle that offered itself to his view, he
began to conceive the most horrible suspicions.</p>

<p>He repulsed my caresses with the most significant disgust: “Wretch!”
exclaims he at length, “you have betrayed your country, a&nbsp;woman who
loved you, a&nbsp;man who prided himself in calling you his son-in-law;
it was only wanting to fill up the measure of your crimes, that you
should league with robbers!”</p>

<p>“With robbers!” cries Titsikan---“with robbers indeed, if it so
please you to call us: but you yourself must acknowledge that
description of people to be good for something; for without me, perhaps,
your daughter, by to-morrow’s sun, would no longer have been a maiden!
Be not alarmed,” said he, addressing himself to me: “but I know that he
is proud, and I therefore am not angry.”</p>

<p>We had by this time placed Pulaski in a chair; his daughter and
myself bathed his manacles with our tears; but he still continued to
<ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: missing ‘me’?">frown
at and</ins> to overwhelm me with reproaches.</p>

<p>“What can you wish for?” cries the Tartar, once more addressing his
captive: “I&nbsp;tell you that Lovzinski is a brave man, whom I intend
to see married; and as for your Dourlinski, he is a rogue, whom I am
about to order to be hanged.</p>

<p>“I repeat to you once more, that you alone are more <i>hot-headed</i>
than us three put together. But hear me, and let us finish this
business, for it is necessary that I should depart. You belong to me by
the most incontestible right, that of the sword. But if you promise me,
upon your honour, that you will be sincerely reconciled to Lovzinski,
and give your daughter to him for a wife, I&nbsp;will restore you to
your liberty.”</p>

<p>“He who can brave death,” replies the haughty Pulaski, “can support
slavery. My daughter shall never be the wife of a traitor.”</p>

<p>“Do you love better that she should be a Tartar’s mistress?<span
class = "locked">---</span>If you do not promise to give her, within the
space of eight days, to this brave man, I&nbsp;myself shall espouse her
this very night! When I am weary of you and of her, I&nbsp;will sell you
to the Turks. Your daughter is handsome enough to find admittance into
the <i>haram</i> of a bashaw: and you yourself may perhaps superintend
the kitchen of some janissary.”</p>

<p>“My life is in your hands; do with it whatsoever you please. If
Pulaski falls beneath the sword of a Tartar, he will be lamented, and
even his enemies will agree that he merits a more glorious destiny: but
if he were to consent: No! no! I&nbsp;rather choose<span class =
"locked">---</span>I prefer death!”</p>

<p>“I do not desire your death! I wish only that Lovzinski should
espouse Lodoiska. What!<span class = "locked">---</span>Shall my
prisoner give the law to me? By my sabre!<span class =
"locked">---</span>this dog of a Christian<span class =
"locked">---</span>but I am in the wrong<span class =
"locked">---</span>he is furious, and is assuredly deprived of his
reason.”</p>

<p>I now beheld the Tartar’s eyes sparkle with fury, and therefore
recalled to his memory the promise he had made me, that he would not
give way to his passion.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page150" id = "page150">150</a></span>
<p>“Undoubtedly! but this man wearies out the patience of a favourite of
our prophet! I&nbsp;am but a robber!<span class = "locked">---</span>Yet
Pulaski, I&nbsp;repeat it to you again, that it is my command that
Lovzinski espouse your daughter. By my sabre, he has fairly gained her;
but for him she had been burnt last night.”</p>

<p>“But for him!”</p>

<p>“Yes! Behold those ruins; there stood a tower in that place; it was
on fire, and no person dared to ascend it: he, however, mounted the
stair-case, attended by Boleslas<span class = "locked">---</span>and
they saved your daughter!”</p>

<p>“Was my daughter in that tower?”</p>

<p>“Yes! that hoary villain had confined her there; that hoary villain,
who attempted to violate her!<span class = "locked">---</span>Some of
you must relate the whole to him; but make haste, as it is necessary
that he should decide instantly; I&nbsp;have business elsewhere, for I
do not intend that your militia<a class = "plain" name = "tag150" id =
"tag150" href = "#note150">*</a> shall surprise me here: it is otherwise
in the plains; there I should laugh at them.”</p>

<p>While Titsikan ordered the rich booty which he had taken, to be
stowed in little covered waggons, Lodoiska informed her father of the
crimes of Dourlinski, and mingled the recital of our affection so
artfully with the history of her misfortunes, that nature and gratitude
at one and the same time began to besiege the heart of Pulaski.</p>

<p>Affected in the most lively manner with the misfortunes of his
daughter, and sensible of the important services which I had rendered
her, he embraces Lodoiska, and at length beholding me without
resentment, he seemed to wait impatiently for an opportunity to be
reconciled to&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>“O Pulaski!” I exclaim, “you whom Heaven hath left me, on purpose to
console me for the loss of the best of fathers; you for whom I have an
equal friendship and veneration; why hast thou condemned thy children
unheard? Why hast thou supposed a man who adores thy daughter, guilty of
the most horrible treason?</p>

<p>“When my vows were offered up in favour of that prince who now fills
the throne, I&nbsp;swear to you, Pulaski, by her whom I love so
tenderly, that I looked upon his elevation to be an event highly
auspicious to the happiness, the safety, and the prosperity of my
country.</p>

<p>“The misfortunes which my youth did not foresee, thy experience had
anticipated: but because I have been wanting in prudence, ought you to
accuse me of perfidy? Ought you to have reproached me for loving my
friend? Can you now look upon it as a crime, that I still give him my
esteem? For the three last months, I&nbsp;have beheld the misfortunes of
my country in the same point of view as yourself: like you, I&nbsp;have
mourned over them; but I am sure that the king is still ignorant of
their extent, and I shall go to Warsaw on purpose to inform him of all
that I have seen.”</p>

<p>Pulaski here interrupts me:---“It is not there that you ought to
repair: you tell me that M. de P*** is not informed of the wrongs done
to his native country, and I
<span class = "pagenum">150b</span>
believe you: but whether he is acquainted with, or whether he is
entirely ignorant of them, is now but of little consequence. Insolent
foreigners, cantoned throughout our provinces, strive to maintain
themselves in the republic, even against the king, whom they have caused
to be elected. It is no longer in the power of an impotent or a
mal-content king, to chase the Russians from my country!</p>

<p>“Let us trust only to ourselves, Lovzinski; and let us either avenge
our country, or die in her defence. I&nbsp;have assembled 4000 noble
Poles in the palatinate of Lublin, who wait but for the return of their
general, to march against the Russians: follow me to my
camp&mdash;&mdash;on this condition I am your friend, and my daughter
shall be your wife!”</p>

<h4>CONJUGAL AFFECTION.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Lady Fanshaw</span>, whose
husband was Clerk of the Council to Charles the First and Second, and
translator of the Pastor Fido, relates the following extraordinary
circumstance in some MSS memoirs of herself, addressed to her son. The
transaction took place during a voyage that Lady Fanshaw made from
Galway to Malaga, in the spring of the year 1649.</p>

<p>“We pursued our voyage with prosperous winds.&mdash;When we had just
passed the Straits, we saw coming towards us, with full sails,
a&nbsp;Turkish galley well manned, and we believed we should be carried
away slaves; for the captain had so laden his ship with goods for Spain,
that his guns were useless, though the ship carried 60 guns. He called
for brandy, and after he had well drunken and all his men, which were
near 200, he called for arms, and cleared the deck as well as he could,
resolving to fight rather than lose his ship, which was worth 30,000l.
This was sad for us passengers, but my husband bid us be sure to keep in
the cabin, and not appear, which would make the Turks think we were a
man of war, but if they saw women, they would take us for merchants and
detain us. He went upon deck, and took a gun, a&nbsp;bandelier, and
sword, expecting the arrival of the Turkish man of war. The beast of a
Captain had locked me up in the cabin<span class = "locked">---</span>I
knocked and called to no purpose, until the cabin-boy came and opened
the door. I, all in tears, desired him to be so good as to give me his
thrum cap and his tarred coat, which he did, and I gave him half a
crown, and putting them on, and flinging away my night-clothes,
I&nbsp;crept up softly, and stood upon the deck by my husband’s side, as
free from sickness and fear as, I&nbsp;confess, of discretion, but it
was the effect of that passion which I could never master. By this time
the two vessels were engaged in parley, and so well satisfied with
speech and sight of each other’s force, that the Turks men tacked about,
and we continued our course. But when your father saw it convenient to
retreat, looking upon me, he blessed himself, and snatched me up in his
arms, saying, “Good God, that love can make this change!” and though he
seemingly chid me, he would laugh at it as often as he remembered that
voyage.”</p>

<p class = "hanging smaller">
The much admired Authoress of <span class = "smallcaps">Evelina</span>,
<span class = "smallcaps">Cecilia</span>, and a work of still greater
merit, entitled <span class = "smallcaps">CAMILLA; or, a&nbsp;picture of
youth</span>: the latter has but just appeared in London, is now in the
press, and will shortly be published by the <span class =
"smallcaps">Editor</span>.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Miss Burney</span>, who has
lately married M. D’Arblay, a French Emigrant, is daughter to the late
Dr. Burney, so well known in the annals of music. At an early age she
was passionately fond of reading novels, which drew on her the censure
of her father, who looked on those then extant, as but ill calculated to
afford any solid improvement or rational amusement. Soon after, Miss
Burney, without the knowledge of her parent, wrote the much admired
history of Evelina<span class = "locked">---</span>, which was
immediately published in London, without disclosing the name of the
author, as she dreaded incurring her father’s displeasure.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney, soon after the publication of Evelina, having
accidentally entered a bookseller’s shop, was presented with this work,
and strongly recommended to purchase it; his general dislike to novels,
prevented his compliance, till strongly urged by the bookseller to give
it even a cursory review: but no sooner had he perused a few pages, than
he made his bargain, and having gone through the whole performance, he
called his daughter, and recommended it to her as the only production of
the kind that merited her attention; observing, that “the other books
she so much read, were entirely beneath her notice, but that he was now
happy in being able to present her with a novel, possessed of such
intrinsic merit, as to render it well worthy her most attentive
perusal.”</p>

<p>How great was Miss Burney’s surprize, on being presented with the
work of her own pen, produced during many a stolen hour snatched from
pleasures or from sleep! yet how flattering and how grateful to her
sensible mind must the eulogium of so excellent a judge have proved!</p>

<p>Encouraged by his approbation, she disclosed the secret to the joy of
a doating parent, who felt proud at having a daughter possessed of a
genius capable of producing a piece which he deemed inimitable. Evelina
went through four editions in the course of the first year, and Cecilia
met with the most unbounded applause. The Queen, hearing so much in
favour of our heroine, gave her the appointment of reader to her
Majesty, with a large salary annexed, but interdicted her from
publishing any thing, as derogatory to the dignity of her station.</p>

<p>Her marriage with Mr. D’Arblay, a gentleman suited to so amiable a
partner, occasioned the loss of her place at court. This circumstance
may be considered as a very considerable advantage to the republic of
letters.</p>

<p>As the sun after a long concealment behind the darkening cloud,
breaks forth with redoubled lustre, to the joy and exhilaration of
mankind<span class = "locked">---</span>so does this amiable writer
appear to the votaries of taste and literature, holding in her hand the

in the most striking and variegated colours the feelings and
propensities of the youthful mind, whether actuated by the celestial
principles inspired by

heaven, or stimulated by the bias of evil examples or vicious
inclinations. Nor does she here omit the opportunity of displaying
virtue in the most fascinating garb, while vice is depicted in the most

the most noble, refined and exalted nature<span class =

instil in the heart of man, the divine attributes of his maker, and
render him as happy as would be consistent with the frailty of his
probationary state. In fine, we may pronounce Camilla a <i>chef
d’œuvre</i>, worthy the perusal of all who are desirous of rational
entertainment, or anxious to have the feelings of the heart awakened to
impressions of the most delightful and charming nature.</p>

<h4>ON CONVERSATION.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">That</span> conversation
may answer the ends for which it was designed, the parties who are to
join in it must come together with a determined resolution to please,
and to be pleased. If a man feels that an east wind has rendered him
dull and sulky, he should by all means stay at home till the wind
changes, and not be troublesome to his friends; for dulness is
infectious, and one sour face will make many, as one cheerful
countenance is soon productive of others. If two gentlemen desire to
quarrel, it should not be done in a company met to enjoy the pleasures
of conversation. It is obvious, for these reasons, that he who is about
to form a conversation party should be careful to invite men of
congenial minds, and of similar ideas respecting the entertainment of
which they are to partake, and to which they must contribute.</p>

<p>With gloomy persons, gloomy topics likewise should be (as indeed they
will&nbsp;be) excluded, such as ill health, bad weather, bad news, or
forebodings of such, &amp;c. To preserve the temper calm and pleasant,
it is of unspeakable importance that we always accustom ourselves thro’
life to make the best of things, to view them on their bright side, and
to represent them to others, for our mutual comfort and encouragement.
Few things (especially if, as christians, we take the other world into
account) but have a bright side; diligence and practice will easily find
it. Perhaps there is no circumstance better calculated than this to
render conversation equally pleasing and profitable.</p>

<p>In the conduct of it, be not eager to interrupt others, or uneasy at
being yourself interrupted; since you speak either to amuse or instruct
the company, or to receive those benefits from it. Give all, therefore,
leave to speak. Hear with patience, and answer with precision.
Inattention is ill manners; it shews contempt; contempt is never
forgiven.</p>

<p>Trouble not the company with your own private concerns, as you do not
love to be troubled with those of others. Yours are as little to them,
as theirs are to you. You will need no other rule whereby to judge of
this matter.</p>

<p>Contrive, but with dexterity and propriety, that each person may have
an opportunity of discoursing on the subject with which he is best
acquainted. He will be
<span class = "pagenum">153b</span>
pleased, and you will be informed. By observing this rule, every one has
it in his power to assist in rendering conversation agreeable; since,
though he may not choose or be qualified, to say much himself, he can
propose questions to those who are able to answer them.</p>

<p>Avoid stories, unless short, pointed, and quite <i>a-propos</i>. He
who deals in them, says Swift, must either have a very large stock, or a
good memory, or must often change his company. Some have a set of them
strung together like onions; they take possession of the conversation by
an early introduction of one; and then you must have the whole rope; and
there is an end of every thing else, perhaps, for that meeting, though
you may have heard all twenty times before.</p>

<p>Talk <i>often</i> but not <i>long</i>. The talent of haranguing in
private company is insupportable. Senators and barristers are apt to be
guilty of this fault; and members, who never harangue in the house, will
often do it out of the house. If the majority of the company be
naturally silent, or cautious, the conversation will flag, unless it be
often renewed by one among them who can start new subjects. Forbear,
however, if possible, to broach a second before the first is out, lest
your stock should not last, and you should be obliged to come back to
the old barrel. There are those who will repeatedly cross upon, and
break into the conversation with a fresh topic, till they have touched
upon all, and exhausted none. Œconomy here is necessary for most
people.</p>

<p>Laugh not at your own wit and humour; leave that to the company.</p>

<p>When the conversation is flowing in a serious and useful channel,
never interrupt it by an ill-timed jest. The stream is scattered, and
cannot be again collected.</p>

<p>Discourse not in a whisper, or half voice, to your next neighbour. It
is ill breeding, and, in some degree, a&nbsp;fraud; conversation-stock
being, as one has well observed, a&nbsp;joint and common property.</p>

<p>In reflexions on absent people, go no farther than you would go if
they were present. ‘I&nbsp;resolve,’ says bishop Beveridge, ‘never to
speak of a man’s virtues to his face, nor of his faults behind his
back;’ a&nbsp;golden rule! the observation of which would, at one
stroke, banish flattery and defamation from the earth.</p>

<p>“Considering the terms on which you already are with her, you will
not be in want of the assistance of my power.” So saying, he took,
a&nbsp;friendly leave of&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>It was indeed high time that the Irishman released me from my
engagement, for my stay at Mad<span class = "locked">---</span>d began
so grow extremely irksome to me. An irresistible power urged me to
return to her who had inthralled me with magic bonds. My separation from
her, and the letters I received from the dear woman, had heated my
passion to the highest degree. Her letters, breathing nothing but
tenderness and affection, were indeed entirely destitute of that fiery
impetuosity of love which characterised mine; however, this was just
adding fuel to the flame, which consumed me. I&nbsp;felt that I could
not live without her. She did not indeed encourage my hope of getting
possession of her hand, yet she did not repel it entirely, and several
hints which Lady Delier had given me, served to support it. I&nbsp;was
already computing with rapture the effect which my unexpected arrival
would produce on Amelia, and made the necessary preparation, for my
return to her without apprising her of it; however, my soul preceded
these preparations, and only the lesser part of it was remaining at
Mad<span class = "locked">---</span>d; no wonder therefore, that the
letters of my father, and the Marquis of Ferei*a, which recalled me to
Port&mdash;&mdash;l, had no effect upon&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>“I cannot divine,” the Marquis wrote to me, “what may have induced
your father to return this year to the capital much earlier than usual.
However, I&nbsp;can tell you that you will scarcely know him again when
you shall see him. Ever since he pretends to have seen the ghost of
Count Santeval, he is changed most wonderfully. He is in a state of
utter apathy, gloomy and reserved, and I may truly say, superstitious.
He avoids, since his late illness, as much as decency will permit, all
conversation, even mine. There is but one person who has free access to
him, and seems to have possessed himself entirely of his confidence. Let
me give you a description of that man.</p>

<p>“Imagine to yourself an elderly man above the middle size, with a
long, thin face, a&nbsp;yellow complexion, a&nbsp;strongly-furrowed
brow, hollow, small, and red eyes,
<span class = "pagenum">154b</span>
and staring, almost deadened features, which, when he smiles, changes
into a kind of grinning. This physiognomy, of which no faithful verbal
description can be given, and which has been stamped in a most
unfavourable manner by nature’s forming hand, is softened by an affected
air of piety; however, if examined minutely and narrowly, peeps with
increased horrors through the borrowed veil. This countenance appears to
me like a dreadful mystery, and I cannot behold it without secret
terror. The <i>tout ensemble</i> of that man exactly fits this head<span
class = "locked">---</span>a sneaking gait&mdash;a stooping neck&mdash;a
grey coat<span class = "locked">---</span>but you must and will see him
yourself. I&nbsp;hate him from the bottom of my soul, and think that he
is not capable of a good action, and that his mere presence must be
sufficient to dispel even from the hearts of others every noble
sentiment. It would be a mystery to me, how your father can converse
with him, if I did not know that he has been blinded by his hypocrisy
and devout discourses. That man (he calls himself <i>Alumbrado</i>)
pretends to be regenerated, and talks a great deal of the gifts of
supernatural light. Your father, who takes for sterling truth whatever
comes from his lips, seems to be more charmed with him every day.
O&nbsp;hasten, my friend, to deliver your father from this ignoble, and,
as I fear, dangerous enchantment. I&nbsp;think that an emotion like that
which the sight of you after so long a separation, must cause in the
mind of your father will be necessary to rouse from his apathy, &amp;c.
&amp;c.&nbsp;&amp;c.”</p>

<p>My situation rendered this letter, as I have already mentioned,
ineffectual. The apprehensions of the Marquis appeared to me
exaggerated; his unfavourable judgment of Alumbrado, originating from
physiognomical reasons, unjust, and uncharitable, and my father old and
sensible enough to see and avoid the danger, if any should be existing.
I&nbsp;deemed the return to the Countess much more pressing than the
journey to <span class = "locked">P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l</span>,
took leave of Oliva*z and Suma*ez, assuring them that the affair
concerning the Duke of <span class = "locked">B&mdash;&mdash;a</span>
had been pushed to a point where it soon would come to a crisis without
our assistance. They were of the same opinion, and dismissed me in a
very obliging manner.</p>

<p>I had already made every preparation for setting out the next
morning, when a letter from Amelia and Lady Delier defeated my design.
The former informed me that a pressing letter from her uncle, who was on
the brink of eternity, and desired to see her once more before his
death, rendered it necessary for her to hasten to Cadiz. In the letter
of the Baroness, which, amongst others, contained the direction of the
Countess at Cadiz, the portrait of Amelia was enclosed.</p>

<p>Amelia’s portrait! the image of those heavenly charms, the
contemplation of which would afford delight even to angels, and the
lifeless imitation of which filled my soul with rapture. O! with what an
unspeakable delight did my entranced eyes imbibe them! how did
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page155" id = "page155">155</a></span>
the sight of him recall to my enraptured bosom all those sweet emotions
which the presence of the original had formerly excited in my
breast.</p>

<p>This softened the blow which repelled me so suddenly from the port of
happiness which I fancied I had almost reached. Alas! this blow
inflicted a deep wound on my heart, which at once found all the sweet
presentments of meeting again changed into the nameless throes of a new
separation. However, the sight of the picture representing to me the
absent darling of my heart, and the secret meaning of that gift gave me
some comfort, and inspired me with new hopes. Who else but my Amelia
could have sent me that present? Her letter did, indeed contain only a
few distant hints, and the picture was enclosed in that of Lady Delier;
yet this did not misguide me, for I was too well acquainted with
Amelia’s delicacy. I&nbsp;resolved now to return to my father, and to
prepare him for my union with the Countess.</p>

<p>I acted wisely in surprising him by my sudden arrival, for otherwise
he would, probably, not have received me with that kindness to which my
unexpected appearance impelled him. No sooner were the first moments of
mutual fondness past, when he said, with apparent coldness, “the world
must have had very irresistible charms for you?”</p>

<p>“The charms of novelty, my dear father.”</p>

<p>“It must have been very painful to you to return to your paternal
house; for it seems you had almost forgot your way homeward.”</p>

<p>“I had much to see, and have experienced a great deal!”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt it; you have had very little leisure for thinking of
your father.”</p>

<p>I endeavoured to refute his reproach which I had expected, and
succeeded pretty well. The Marquis grew warmer and more affectionate; he
enquired after my tutor and Count Clairval. It seemed to wound him
deeply that I could give no satisfactory account of the former. With
regard to the latter, I&nbsp;told him that important family affairs had
called him from me unexpectedly.</p>

<p>My father appeared then not to be in a favourable disposition for
listening to an account of my connection with the Countess, and how
strongly soever the impulse of my heart pressed me to speak on that
subject, yet prudence advised me to wait for a more favourable
opportunity. The following morning appeared to me propitious for that
purpose. My father was very cheerful, and I contrived being surprised by
him with Amelia’s picture in my hand.</p>

<p>“What have you there?” he asked me.</p>

<p>“The picture of the Dowager Countess of Clairval.”</p>

<p>“How far is she related to your travelling companion?”</p>

<p>“She was married to his brother.”</p>

<p>“So young, and already a widow?” said he, looking at the picture;
“I&nbsp;should have mistaken it for the
<span class = "pagenum">155b</span>
picture of a girl of seventeen years. However, the painters are used to
flatter.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, the original possesses numberless charms which have
escaped the artist.”</p>

<p>“Then the Countess must be extremely handsome.”</p>

<p>“She is an angel.”</p>

<p>“The face is more interesting than handsome.”</p>

<p>“Handsome and interesting to a high degree.”</p>

<p>“You are in love with her.”</p>

<p>“My father&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I should be very sorry at it.”</p>

<p>“For what reason?” I asked, thunderstruck.</p>

<p>“The young Princess of L**** &mdash;what do you think of her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like her at all.”</p>

<p>“This would grieve me extremely, for I have chosen her for your
wife<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ?">”.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“My heart has already chosen. Your consent, my father&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The Countess of Clairval? Never!”</p>

<p>“You don’t know her. Her family and fortune are very
considerable.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will not liken her, in that respect, to the Princess
of&nbsp;L****?”</p>

<p>“Not at all! but the amiable character of the Countess&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The character of the Princess is without blame. My dear son,
consider the splendor and the honour which our family would derive from
that alliance. Consider that you will render me happy by that union.
When you, by my desire, broke off your connection with a certain Darbis,
you revived my hope of seeing you allied to the family of L****; do not
thwart my plan by a new love, do not cross my fondest wishes. You are,
indeed, your own master, and may chuse for yourself; you must, however,
not expect my consent and a father’s blessing, if you do not marry the
Princess of L****. I&nbsp;am sensible that it will give you pain to
renounce the Countess, and for that reason will not press you farther at
present. I&nbsp;shall not desire you to come to a resolution before the
end of seven weeks. Till then, do not mention a word about the
matter.”</p>

<p>Seeing that I was going to reply, he took me by the hand. “Be a man,”
said he, “who knows how to conquer juvenile passions. Gain my regard as
you have gained my affection. My life is joyless, do not make me hate
it. My dear son, I&nbsp;have sacrificed much for you, sacrifice now in
return a little for your father!” So saying, he left&nbsp;me.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> monaulos, or
single flute, called by the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for Egyptians">Egyptions</ins> photinx, was probably
one of the most ancient instruments used either by them or any other
nation. From various remains of ancient sculpture, it appears to have
been shaped like a bull’s horn, and was at first, it may be supposed, no
other than the horn itself.<span class = "locked">---</span>Before the
invention of flutes, as no other instruments except those of percussion
were known, music must have been little more than metrical, when the art
of refining and lengthening sounds was first discovered, the power of
Music over mankind, from the agreeable surprize occasioned by soft and
extended notes was probably irresistable. At a time when all the rest of
the world was involved in savage ignorance, the Egyptians were possessed
of musical instruments capable of much variety and
expression.&mdash;&mdash;Of this the astonishing remains of the city of
Thebes, still subsisting, afford ample evidence. In a letter from Mr.
Bruce, ingrossed in Dr. Burney’s history of Music, there is given a
particular description of the Theban harp, an instrument of extensive
compass, and exquisite elegance of form. It is accompanied with a
drawing taken from the ruins of an ancient sepulchre at Thebes, supposed
by Mr. Bruce, to be that of the father of Sesostris.</p>

<p>On the subject of this harp, Mr. Bruce makes the following striking
observation. “It overturns all the accounts of the earliest state of
ancient music, and instruments in Egypt, and is altogether in its form,
ornaments, and compass, an incontestable proof, stronger than a thousand
Greek quotations, that geometry, drawing, mechanics, and music, were at
the greatest perfection when this harp was made; and that what we think
in Egypt was the invention of arts, was only the beginning of the era of
their restoration.”</p>

<p>Indeed, when the beauty and powers of this harp, along with the very
great antiquity of the painting which represents it, are considered,
such an opinion as that which Mr. Bruce hints at, does not seem to be
devoid of probability.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted, that during the reigns of the Ptolemies, who
were voluptuous Princes, Music must have been much cultivated and
encouraged. The father of Cleopatra, who was the last of that race of
Kings, derived his title of Auletes, or flute player, from excessive
attachment to the flute. Like Nero, he used to array himself in the
dress of a Tibicien, and exhibited his performance in the public musical
contests.</p>

<p>The Greeks are indebted to the Egyptians for their knowledge of
music; Homer, the most ancient author unconnected with the sacred
writers, has given us very striking descriptions of the efficacy of
music. We are told Apollo invented the Lyre, and instructed Orpheus to
play upon it. The Lyric and Dramatic poets were all
<span class = "pagenum">156b</span>
after the time of Homer, proficients in music, and in all probability
contributed much to the perfection of that art in Greece. We are well
assured, that in the days of Philip, and his son Alexander the Great,
Music had arrived to its highest degree of perfection. From Greece it
made its way to Rome, and from Rome it spread abroad over all the
countries of Europe.</p>

<h4><span class = "super">ON CONTENTMENT</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> world has been
often, and properly enough, compared to a theatre, in which men step
forth to public view, and act their several parts. These parts are
allotted by the Governor of the Universe, who best knows the characters
to which we are suited; and it is our greatest wisdom to acquiesce in
them, and to endeavour to sustain them with propriety, whilst we are
upon the stage of this life.<span class = "locked">---</span>Happiness
is distributed with a more impartial hand than we generally imagine. It
consists not in the possession of riches and honours, in outward shew
and splendor: it is something internal. It is seated in the mind, and if
we seek it elsewhere, we shall seek it in vain. The contented peasant in
his humble cot is happy with a sufficiency, whilst the greatest Lord in
the Universe, in the midst of all his wealth and grandeur, is often a
prey to anxiety and discontent. Does not the poor beggar, with all his
apparent want, frequently enjoy more real happiness than the rich miser
in the midst of his abundance? The latter is continually tormented with
the fear of losing his superfluous treasures: eager of adding to his
store, he even denies himself common necessaries, and leads a miserable
life; whilst the former, unmindful of future wants, is heard to sing
over his scanty meal. Contentment is a most valuable blessing. It is the
sovereign medicine of afflictions. By bearing them with patience and
resignation, we in a great measure lessen their weight, and are better
prepared to withstand any future adverse stroke of fortune. But instead
of alleviating, we only add to our troubles by repining. Often do we
wantonly contrive to be our own tormentors, by looking with an envious
ill-natured eye, upon the condition of others, or by contemplating only
the dark side of our own. Often, too often, do we reject our own
happiness, by neglecting every substantial blessing that is within our
reach; and court misery, by creating imaginary wants to ourselves, and
hunting after some fugitive enjoyment, which, like a shadow always flies
from us in proportion to the swiftness with which it is pursued.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“Pulaski</span>, I am ready
to obey you: I swear to follow your fortunes, and to participate in your
dangers. And think not that it is Lodoiska alone, who has exacted from
me this oath: I&nbsp;love my country as much as I adore thy daughter;
I&nbsp;swear by her, and before you, that the enemies of the republic
have always been, and shall never cease to be mine: I&nbsp;swear that I
will spill the very last drop of my blood, to chase those foreigners out
of Poland, who reign there in the name of its king!”</p>

<p>“Embrace me, Lovzinski! I now recognise you; I adopt you for my
son-in-law&mdash;My children, all our misfortunes are at an end!”</p>

<p>Pulaski desired me to unite my hand to Lodoiska’s, in token of our
union; and we were embracing the brave palatine at the very moment that
Titsikan re-entered.</p>

<p>“Good! good!” exclaims the chieftain: this is what I wished;
I&nbsp;am fond of marriages. Father, I&nbsp;shall instantly order you to
be unbound.</p>

<p>“By my sabre!” adds the Tartar, while his followers were cutting the
cords with which the hands and feet of Pulaski were tied; “by my sabre!
I&nbsp;shall do a noble action, but it will cost me a world of wealth!
Two grandees of Poland! a&nbsp;beautiful maiden! They would have
produced me a large ransom!”</p>

<p>“Titsikan, such a thought is not worthy of you!” says Pulaski,
interrupting him.</p>

<p>“No! no!” rejoins the Tartar, “it is a mere reflection only<span

cannot prevent.<span class = "locked">---</span>My brave and unfortunate

you a litter, on which I myself have been carried for these last ten or
twelve days. This young man here had given me such a wound, that I could
no longer sit on horseback.<span class = "locked">---</span>The litter
is indeed a bad one, clumsily constructed, by means of branches of
trees; but I have nothing except that or a little covered waggon, to
offer you: choose which ever of them you please.”</p>

<p>In the mean time, Dourlinski, who had not as yet uttered a single
word, remained with his eyes fixed upon the ground, while an air of
consternation was spread over his countenance.</p>

<p>“Unworthy friend!” says Pulaski to him, “how could you so cruelly
abuse the confidence I reposed in you? Were you not afraid to expose
yourself to my resentment? What demon blinded you?”</p>

<p>“Love!” replies Dourlinski, “an outrageous love! You, perhaps, do not
comprehend to what excess the passions
<span class = "pagenum">157b</span>
may hurry on a man, violent and jealous by nature. This frightful
example, however, ought to teach you, that a daughter so charming as
yours is a treasure which one ought not to entrust to any person.</p>

<p>“Pulaski, I have, indeed, merited your hatred; but I am still worthy
of your pity. I&nbsp;have rendered myself exceedingly culpable; but you
behold me cruelly punished. I&nbsp;lose, in one single day, my rank, my
riches, my <ins class = "correction" title = ", missing">honour,</ins>
my liberty! more than all this, I&nbsp;lose thy daughter!</p>

<p>“O, Lodoiska! lovely maiden, whom I have so much outraged, will you
deign to forget my persecutions, your danger, and your grief? Will you
deign to grant to me a generous pardon?</p>

<p>“Ah! if there are no crimes which a sincere repentance cannot
expiate, Lodoiska, I&nbsp;am no longer criminal. I&nbsp;would I were
able, at the price of all my blood, to redeem those tears which I have
occasioned you to shed. Amidst the horrible state to which Dourlinski is
about to be reduced, shall he not be permitted to carry with him the
consoling recollection of having heard you tell him, that he is no
longer odious to you?</p>

<p>“Too amiable, and until this present moment, too unfortunate maiden!
however great my wrongs may have been in regard to you, I&nbsp;have it
in my power to repair them all by means of a single word<span class =
"locked">---</span>advance<span class = "locked">---</span>approach
me<span class = "locked">---</span>I have a secret which can only be
entrusted to your private ear: it is exceedingly important that it
should be revealed to you!”</p>

<p>Lodoiska, without the least distrust, now leaves my side, and
advances towards him without suspicion.</p>

<p>At that very moment I beheld a poniard glittering in the hand of
Dourlinski!</p>

<p>I precipitate myself upon him.---It was too late; for I could only
parry the second thrust; and the lovely Lodoiska, wounded immediately
above the left breast, had already fallen senseless at the feet of
Titsikan!</p>

<p>Pulaski, furious at the horrid treason, drew his sabre quick as
lightning, on purpose to avenge his daughter’s fate.</p>

<p>“No! no!” exclaims the Tartar, at the same time withholding his arm:
“you are about to make this wretch suffer too gentle a death!”</p>

<p>“It is well,” says the infamous assassin, addressing himself to me,
and at the same time contemplating his victim with a cruel joy.
“Lovzinski you appeared but now eager to be united with Lodoiska; why do
you not follow her? Go, my too happy rival, go and accompany your
mistress to the tomb! Let them prepare my <i>punishment</i>; it will
appear pleasant to me: I&nbsp;leave you to torments no less cruel, and
infinitely longer than mine.”</p>

<p>Dourlinski was not allowed to utter another sentence, for the Tartars
rushed in upon him, and threw him into the midst of the burning
ruins.<br>
<span class = "word2"> * * * * * * * * * * *</span></p>

<p>What a night! how many different cares, how many opposite sentiments
agitated my unhappy mind during its continuance! How many times did I
experience the successive
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page158" id = "page158">158</a></span>
emotions of fear, hope, grief and joy! After so many dangers and
inquietudes, Lodoiska was at length presented to me by her father, and I
was intoxicated with the near hope of possessing her:<span class =
"locked">---</span>a barbarian had but now assassinated her in my
pretence!</p>

<p>This was the most cruel and unfortunate moment of any during the
whole course of my life!<span class = "locked">---</span>But my
happiness eclipsed, as it were, in a single instant, was not long in
shining forth with all its former splendor.</p>

<p>Amidst the Tartars belonging to Titsikan, was one somewhat conversant
in surgery. We sent for him; on his arrival he examines the wound, and
assures us that it is but a slight one. The infamous Dourlinski,
constrained by his chains, and blinded by his despair, had happily been
prevented from giving any other than an ill-directed blow.</p>

<p>As soon as Titsikan was informed that the life of Lodoiska was not in
any danger, he prepared to take leave of&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>“I leave you,” said he, “the five domestics who accompanied Pulaski;
provisions for several days, arms, six excellent horses, two covered
waggons, and the people belonging to Dourlinski in chains. Their base
lord is no more! Adieu! the day is about to appear; do not leave this
place until to-morrow; I&nbsp;shall then visit the other cantons. Adieu,
brave Poles! tell to your countrymen that Titsikan is not so bad as he
has been represented to them; and that he sometimes restores with one
hand what he takes with another. Adieu!”</p>

<p>At these words he lifts his hand to his head, and having saluted us
gracefully after the manner of his country, he gives the signal to
depart: the Tartars mount their fleet coursers in an instant, pass along
the drawbridge, and make for the neighbouring plain at a full
gallop.</p>

<p>They had been gone scarcely two hours when several of the
neighbouring nobility, supported by a detachment of militia, came on
purpose to invest the castle of Dourlinski.</p>

<p>Pulaski himself went out to receive them: he related the particulars
of all that had occurred; and some, gained over by his eloquence,
promised to follow us to the palatinate of Lublin.</p>

<p>They asked for only two days to prepare every thing necessary for the
expedition, and actually came and rejoined us at the appointed time, to
the number of sixty.</p>

<p>Lodoiska having assured us that she was now able to undergo the
fatigues of a journey, we placed her in a commodious carriage, which we
had luckily been able to procure for this purpose.</p>

<p>After having restored Dourlinski’s people to liberty, we abandon the
two covered waggons to them, in which Titsikan, acting with his usual
generosity, had left part <ins class = "correction"
title = "word invisible">of</ins> his immense booty: this we divided among them in
equal proportions.</p>

<p>We arrived, without meeting with any accident, at Polowisk, in the
Palatinate of Lublin, this being the place which Pulaski had appointed
for the general rendezvous.</p>

<p>The news of his return having gone abroad, a crowd
<span class = "pagenum">158b</span>
of malecontents in the space of less than a month flocked to and
increased our little army to such a degree, that we soon found it to
amount to no less than 10,000 men.</p>

<p>Lodoiska entirely cured of her wound, and perfectly recovered from
her fatigues, had regained her usual spirits, and appeared in possession
of all her former beauty. Pulaski one day called me into his tent, and
spoke as follows. “Three thousand Russians have appeared, as you well
know, upon the heights above, and at no greater distance than half a
league from us: take, in the course of the ensuing night, three thousand
chosen men, and go and chase the enemy from the advantageous posts which
they now occupy. Recollect that on the success of a first attempt
depends almost always that of the campaign; recollect that you are about
to avenge your country’s wrongs; recollect too, my friend, that
to-morrow I shall learn thy victory, and that to-morrow also thou shalt
espouse Lodoiska!”</p>

three days before the trial the patient’s arm was inclosed in a bag, and

<h4>ANECDOTE OF DR. GOLDSMITH.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Those</span> in the least
acquainted with the private character of the doctor, knew that
<i>economy</i> and <i>foresight</i> were not amongst the catalogue of
his virtues. In the suite of his pensioners (and he generally enlarged
his list as he enlarged his finances) was the late unfortunate Jack
Pilkington, of scribbling memory, who had served the doctor so many
tricks, that he despaired of getting any more money from him, without
coming out with a <i>chef d’œuvre</i> once for all. He accordingly
called on the doctor one morning, and running about the room in a fit of
joy, told him his fortune was made, “How so, Jack?” says the doctor.
“Why,” says Jack, “the duchess of Marlborough, you must know, has long
had a strange <i>penchant</i> for a pair of <i>white mice</i>; now, as I
knew they were sometimes to be had in the East Indies,
I&nbsp;commissioned a friend of mine, who was going out then, to get
them for me, and he is this morning arrived with two of the most
beautiful little animals in nature.” After Jack had finished this
account with a transport of joy, he lengthened his visage by telling the
doctor all was ruined, for without <i>two guineas</i> to buy a cage for
the <i>mice</i>, he could not present them. The doctor unfortunately, as
he said himself, had but half a guinea in the world, which he offered
him. But Pilkington was not to be beat out of his scheme; he perceived
the doctor’s watch hanging up in his room, and after premising on the
indelicacy of the proposal, hinted, that if he could spare that watch
for a week, he could raise a few guineas on it, which he would repay him
with gratitude. The doctor would not be the means of spoiling a man’s
fortune for such a trifle. He accordingly took down the watch, and gave
it to him, which Jack immediately took to the pawn-brokers, raised what
he could on it, and never once looked after the doctor, till he sent to
borrow another half guinea from him on his death-bed; which the other,
under such circumstances, very generously sent him.</p>

<h4>FUGITIVE TRIFLES.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Every</span> species of
vice originates either from insensibility, from want of judgment, or
from both. No maxim can be more true than that all vice is folly. For
either by vice we bring misery more immediately on ourselves, or we
involve others in misery; if any one bring evil on himself, it is surely
folly; if his present pleasure be to make others miserable, were he to
escape every other punishment, he must suffer for it by remorse, or it
is a certain proof he is deprived of that sense or sympathy which is the
opposite to dullness; in either of which cases, it is evident that all
vice is folly.</p>

<h4>ON LAUGHING.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">To</span> form a true
judgment of a person’s temper, begin with an observation on his
<i>laugh</i>; for the people are never so unguarded as when they are
pleased; and laughter being a visible symptom of some inward
satisfaction, it is then, if ever, we may believe the face; but for
method sake, it will be necessary to point out the several kinds of
laughing, under the following heads:</p>

<p>The dimplers.&mdash;The smilers.&mdash;The laughers.&mdash;The
grinners.<span class = "locked">---</span>The horse-laughers.</p>

<p>The dimple is practised to give a grace to the features, and is
frequently made a bait to entangle a gazing lover. This was called by
the ancients, the chain-laugh.</p>

<p>The smile is for the most part confined to the fair sex, and their
male retinue; it expresses our satisfaction in a silent sort of
approbation, and does not disorder the features too much, and is
therefore practised by lovers of the most delicate address.</p>

<p>The grin is generally made use of to display a beautiful set of
teeth.</p>

<p>The horse-laugh is made use of with great success, in all kinds of
disputation. The proficients in this kind, by a well-timed laugh, will
baffle the most solid argument. This, upon all occasions, supplies the
want of reason, and is received with great applause in coffee-house
disputes; that side the laugh joins with, is generally observed to gain
the better of his antagonist.</p>

<p>The prude has a wonderful esteem for the chain-laugh or dimple; she
looks upon all other kinds of laughter as <i>excessives</i> of levity,
and is never seen upon the most extravagant jests, to disorder her
features with a smile; her lips are composed with a primness peculiar to
her character; all her modesty seems collected into her face, and but
very rarely takes the freedom to sink her cheek into a dimple. The
effeminate fop, by the long exercise of his countenance at the glass, is
in the same situation, and you may generally see him admire his own
eloquence by a dimple.</p>

<p>The young widow is only a chain for a time; her smiles are confined
by decorum, and she is obliged to
<span class = "pagenum">161b</span>
make her face sympathise with her habit; she looks demure by art, and by
the strictest rule of decency is never allowed to smile, till the first
offer or advance to her is over.</p>

<p>The wag generally calls in the horse-laugh to his assistance.</p>

<p>There are another kind of grinners, which some people term sneerers.
They always indulge their mirth at the expence of their friends, and all
their ridicule consists in unseasonable ill-nature; but they should
consider, that let them do what they will, they never can laugh away
their own folly by sneering at other people’s.</p>

<p>The coquette has a great deal of the sneerer in her composition; but
she must be allowed to be a proficient in laughter, and one who can run
through all the exercise of the features: she subdues the formal lover
with the dimple<span class = "locked">---</span>accosts the fop with a
smile&mdash;joins with the wit in a downright laugh:<span class =
"locked">---</span>to vary the air of her countenance, she frequently
rallies with a grin<span class = "locked">---</span>and when she hath
ridiculed her lover quite out of his understanding, she, to complete his
misfortunes, strikes him dumb with the horse-laugh.</p>

<p>At present the most fashionable is a mixture of the horse-laugh and
the grin, so happily blended together, that the teeth are shown without
the face being distorted.</p>

<h4>EXTRAVAGANCE AND AVARICE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Some</span> rich men starve
to-day for fear of starving to-morrow, (as a man leaps into the sea to
avoid being drowned) and the indigent often consume in an hour what they

cannot want it, and young men throw it away because it is necessary to
their subsistence.</p>

<p>He is rich enough that needs neither flatter nor borrow, and truly
rich that is satisfied: want lies in desire.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">O!</span> Why did he
request me <i>such</i> a manner to make him a sacrifice which would have
rendered me miserable! I&nbsp;wished then the first time in my life,
that he had spoken to me in a menacing, domineering, or only in a harsh
tone, then I should have had a pretext for resisting him, and enforcing
my own will. But how could I have had the courage to contradict that
tender solicitation, that entreating persuasion of a father. And yet,
was I not necessitated to do something worse, to counteract my parent?
I&nbsp;never felt more strongly than at that moment, that it was utterly
impossible for me to renounce the possession of Amelia. Alas! never was
a situation more unfortunate than mine, and never has a human heart been
reduced to such a dreadful conflict with itself by two people so dear as
my father and Amelia were to&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>I looked around with weeping eyes in search of a person to whom I
could unbosom my straitened heart. I&nbsp;went to the Marquis of
Ferei*a.<a class = "plain" name = "tag162" id = "tag162" href =
"#note162">*</a></p>

<p>I had not informed him of my return; he uttered a scream of joy when
he saw me enter his apartment. However, his satisfaction at my return
made room to sorrow, when I acquainted him with my deplorable situation.
“Yes, my friend!” said he, after he had viewed me some minutes with
looks of pity, “if it is in your power to subdue that passion, then let
me implore you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t finish that sentence!” I interrupted him, “it is
impossible!”</p>

<p>“If that is the case, then only two ways are left to you to attain
the consent of your father; one of which is tedious and rugged, but
straight.”</p>

<p>“Name it!”</p>

<p>“You must endeavour to work upon the nerves of the paternal heart in
such a manner, that his affection for you gets the better of his
ambition.”</p>

<p>“And the second---”</p>

<p>“It is a bye-road which will lead you soon and safely to the
mark<span class = "locked">---</span>serpents are, however, lurking on
that road, and tygers lying in ambush<span class =
"locked">---</span>”</p>

<p>“Don’t name it!”</p>

<p>“I will name it, in order to caution you against it<span class =
"locked">---</span>it is called Alumbrado. O&nbsp;my friend!” squeezing
my hand affectionately, “go take the straightest road.”</p>

<p>“That I will, you have given me a very bad character of that
Alumbrado.”</p>

<p>“And would not retract a syllable of what I have wrote.”</p>

<p>“Where is he, I have not yet seen him.”</p>

<p>“He is abroad.”</p>

<p>“I am curious to get acquainted with him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t come near him, lest he catch you in the same snare in which he
has caught your father.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">162b</span>
<p>“Fear nothing, I shall endeavour to deliver my father from that
shameful captivity.”</p>

<p>“O! if you could do it! But be on your guard, lest he whom you are
going to draw out of the pit, drag you after him into the abyss.”</p>

<p>I promised it, and he clasped me in his arms.</p>

<p>Previous to my departure from P&mdash;&mdash;l, I had promised the
Marquis to keep a journal, and to insert the most remarkable incidents,
which I was to communicate to him after my return. He enquired now after
that journal.</p>

<p>“It abounds with remarkable incidents,” I replied, “and you will
learn strange things on perusing it: I&nbsp;have not mentioned a
syllable of them in my letters to you, in order to surprise you.
However, you must curb your curiosity till I shall have arranged my
papers.”</p>

<p>The Marquis consented to my request.</p>

<p>My noble friend! you will forgive me that artifice. It was a mere
pretext, in order to stay your curiosity till the revolution should have
taken place; for I had promised the Irishman to observe the strictest
silence till then. It was no mistrust that influenced me, but duty
imposed upon me by the promise I had made; and the event proved that I
acted wisely in doing&nbsp;so.</p>

<p>Four days after my first meeting with my friend, the Irishman stopped
me one evening in going home. His eyes flashed like lightning, his
features were distorted, his countenance was truly dreadful. “Have you,”
said he, grinding his teeth, “betrayed the conspiracy to Vascon*ellos?”
“No<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has .">”,&nbsp;</ins>I&nbsp;replied. “Have you warned him of the impending
danger in some other manner?” “No.” “Have you disclosed the secret to
one of your friends?” “To no man living.” “Can you pledge your honour
for the truth of your declaration?” “I&nbsp;can.”</p>

<p>These questions succeeded each other rapidly, and he left me with
equal haste. I&nbsp;was almost petrified at this incident. My
astonishment, however, soon gave place to a different sensation, for I
concluded from the words, and the perturbation of the Irishman, nothing
less than that the plot had been discovered. The intelligence which I
gained afterwards seemed to confirm this conjecture. Vasconcel*os had
left his castle suddenly and crossed the river Ta*o, a&nbsp;circumstance
that justly had raised the suspicion of his having discovered the plot
through one of his numberless spies, and instantly made preparations for
seizing the conspirators. However, this apprehension was refuted that
very night. Vasconcel*os had only been at a feast, and returned late at
night in high spirits, and preceded by a band of musicians, not
suspecting that he would be a dead man at that hour the following night.
I&nbsp;myself did not imagine that the revolution would break out so
soon, although I knew that event to be drawing near. The day following,
(December 1, 1640) at eight o’clock in the morning, the conspirators
repaired in small divisions from all parts of the town to the Ducal
Palace, partly on horseback, and partly on foot, but most of them in
coaches or chairs, in order to conceal their arms. The number of
noblemen, most of whom were the chiefs of their families, amounted to
fifty, and that of the citizens to two hundred. As soon as it had
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page163" id = "page163">163</a></span>
struck eight by the clock of the cathedral<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has .">,&nbsp;</ins>Pinto Rib**ro, one of the Duke’s privy
counsellors, gave the last signal for the attack by firing a pistol, and
the conspirators marched to the different places of their
destination.</p>

<p>Pinto Rib**ro repaired with his troop to the palace of Vascon*ellos,
who was so little prepared for the unexpected attack, that he scarcely
could get time to conceal himself in a chest. However, he was
discovered, saluted with a pistol shot, stabbed with a number of
poniards, and thrown out of the window amid the loud exclamation; “The
tyrant is dead! long live liberty and King John, the new Sovereign of
Port***l!”</p>

<p>The populace who were assembled under the windows of the palace,
repeated these words with loud acclamations of joy. In order to protect
the corpse against the fury of the mob, the society of charity pressed
their way thro’ the crowd, and carried it away on a bier, which is only
used at the burials of slaves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another troop had penetrated into the palace of the
Vice-Queen. The Archbishop of Bra*a, who was with her, and as a near
relation of Vasconcel**s, had also been doomed to destruction, was saved
with great difficulty from the fury of the conspirators by the
intercession of Miguel d’Al*eida. The Vice-Queen turned to the
conspirators when they rushed into her apartment, declaring that
Vasconce*los had deserved their hatred, but that they would be treated
as rebels if they should proceed a step farther. She however was told,
that so many nobles had not assembled merely on account of a wretch who
ought to have been executed by the public hangman, but in order to
restore the crown to the Duke of Bra&mdash;za, who was the lawful owner
of it. The Vice-Queen began to talk of the power which she had been
entrusted with by the king of Spa*n. The reply was, that no one could be
acknowledged as King but John, Duke of B&mdash;&mdash;a. She now offered
to run out of the apartment in order to implore the assistance of the
people; however, some of the noblemen stopped her, telling her it would
be dangerous to suffer her to appear before a people who had been
oppressed many years, and were highly exasperated.<span class =
"locked">---</span>“And what could the people do to me?” she said with
scornful looks. “Nothing else but throw your highness out of the
window;” one of the noblemen replied. The Archbishop of Bra*a was so
much exasperated at this speech, that he seized a sword in order to
avenge the Vice-Queen. Almei*a however embraced and entreated him to
retire, because he had had great difficulty to persuade the conspirators
to spare his life. This discovery disarmed at once the zeal of the
Prelate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the chiefs of the Spani&mdash;ds had been seized, and the
conspirators requested the Vice-Queen to send an order to the Commander
of St. Ge* to surrender; for that castle, which commanded the whole
town, was still in the possession of the Spani&mdash;ds. The Vice-Queen
refused to comply with their request; yet when she was told that her
refusal would be the signal for killing all the imprisoned
Spani&mdash;ds, she drew up the desired order, expecting that no
attention would be paid to it. However
<span class = "pagenum">163b</span>
the commander of the castle, who did not dare to defend himself,
executed her order literally, and thus the town was freed of all fear.
It is almost incredible how quickly and easily the four troops of the
confederates took the posts allotted to them, and gained their aim. But
much more astonishing is the readiness and the quickness with which not
only the whole kingdom, but also all foreign settlements followed the
example of the capital. The revolution no sooner had begun than it was
accomplished. It is the only one in its kind, and a similar one never
will happen.<span class = "locked">---</span>The execution of it proves
with how much wisdom it has been designed and conducted.</p>

<p>It was, however, like a sudden clap of thunder to my father, and
affected him with redoubled force, because it happened so unexpectedly.
The slow rising of the tempest, the silent brewing on the political
horizon had been concealed from him by his retirement from the world,
and even the visible forerunners of it, which at last forced themselves
upon his eyes, appeared to him to be nothing but the lightning arising
from transient vapours. The sudden eruption of the tempest, and its
consequences almost petrified him. His silent stupor soon gave room to
the loudest manifestations of his dissatisfaction; and nothing but
repeated persuasions to yield to stern necessity and superiority, could
prevail upon him to remain quiet.</p>

character, after having long figured away in the gay world at Paris, was
at length compelled to live in an obscure retreat in that city, the
victim of severe and unforeseen misfortunes. He was so indigent, that he
subsisted only on an allowance from the parish. Every week a quantity of
bread was sent to him sufficient for his support, and yet at length he
demanded more. On this the curate sent for him. He went: “Do you live
alone?” said the curate; “With whom, sir,” answered the unfortunate man,
“is it possible I should live? I&nbsp;am wretched; you see that I am,
since I thus solicit charity, and am abandoned by all the world.” “But,
sir,” continued the curate, “if you live alone, why do you ask for more
bread than is sufficient for yourself?” The other was quite
disconcerted, and at last, with great reluctance, confessed that he had
a dog. The curate did not drop the subject. He desired him to observe,
that he was only the distributor of the bread that belonged to the poor,
and that it was absolutely necessary that he should dispose of his dog.
“Ah, sir,” exclaimed the poor man, weeping; “and if I should lose my
dog, who is there then to love me?” The good pastor melting into tears,
took his purse, and giving it to him, “take this, sir,” said he; “this

<p class = "center"><i>From ‘<span class = "smallcaps">Watkins’</span>
Travels into Swisserland, Italy, Sicily,’&nbsp;&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Lorenzo Musata</span>, a
native of Catania, in Sicily, was, in the year 1774, taken in a Maltese
ship by an Algerine corsair. When the prize was carried into port, he
was sold to a Turkish officer, who treated him with all the severity
that the unfeeling disposition of a barbarian, rendered intolerable by
bigotry, could inflict. It happened fortunately for the Sicilian, that
his master’s son Fezulah, (about ten years old) became extremely fond of
him; and, by numberless little offices of kindness, alleviated his
slavery. Lorenzo, in consequence, became as much attached to the boy, as
the boy was to him; so that they were seldom separate from each other.
One day, as Fezulah (being then sixteen) was bathing in the sea, the
current carried him off; and he certainly would have perished, had not
Lorenzo plunged in, and saved him, at the hazard of his life. His
affection was now heightened by gratitude, and he frequently interceded
with his father for his deliverer’s emancipation, but in vain. Lorenzo
often sighed for his country, and Fezulah determined that he should
return there. With this resolution, he one night conveyed him on board
an English merchant-ship that lay off Algiers; and having embraced him
with tears, retired with all that exquisite glow of pleasure and
self-approbation, which virtue feels in acting with gratitude and
generosity. The Sicilian returned to his country, where he found that a
relation had bequeathed him a small tenement; upon which he settled, and
enjoyed the sweets of competency and repose, rendered infinitely more
grateful, than they otherwise would have been, by the remembrance of his
past slavery. At length growing tired of a sedentary life, he
accompanied his kinsman, a&nbsp;master of a vessel, to Genoa. On landing
in the D’arsena, he heard a voice cry out&mdash;‘Oh, my friend, my
Lorenzo,’ and instantly found himself in the arms of Fezulah. He was at
first lost in surprize and joy; but how rapid was the transition to
grief, when he perceived by his chains that Fezulah was a
slave!&mdash;He had been taken by a Genoese galley on his voyage to
Aleppo. You have already seen that the ruling passions of Lorenzo’s
breast were generosity and gratitude; and to these he now determined to
sacrifice every other consideration. Having divided his purse with his
former companion, he took his leave, telling him he should be again at
Genoa within two months. And so he was. He returned to Sicily; sold his
little tenement, though to great disadvantage, and with the money
ransomed his friend, whom he sent back to his country. Fezulah has
lately visited Lorenzo at Catania, where they now are, and has not only
re-purchased for him his estate, but considerably enriched him.</p>

<p>These actions might by some, who have more prudence than
philanthropy, be deemed enthusiastic; I&nbsp;must however, consider them
as genuine virtue, and am only sorry I cannot be an associate in the
friendship of Fezulah and Lorenzo.</p>

<h4 class = "ital"><em>ANECDOTE</em> of the Celebrated <em>JOHN</em> de
<em>WITT</em>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">This</span> illustrious
pensionary of Holland, when he was one day asked how he could get
through with ease the immense load of business, that would oppress most
other men; replied, by doing one thing at a time. Another of his maxims,
in the conduct of life, and of still more value than all his political
ones, was to be careful of his health, but careless of his life. This
great man well knew the importance of health to the mental as well as to
the corporeal functions, and at the same time was convinced that in
certain situations, where the duty to one’s country, to one’s relations,
to one’s friends, and to one’s self, demands it, that a sacrifice of
those is justly and honourably made, and that not to make it is “propter
vitam vivendi perdere causam.” The manner of life of this great man, was
so simple, that though his name appeared by the side of that of emperors
and of kings in many public acts, that he used to walk from his own
house to that of the States at the Hague, attended only by a single
servant, and that one man and one maid-servant composed his whole
domestic establishment.</p>

<h4><span class = "super">ON IMAGINATION</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> imagination is a
quality of the soul, not only a brilliant but an happy one, for it is
more frequently the cause of our happiness, than of our misery; it
presents us with more pleasures than vexations, with more hopes than
fears. Men of dull and heavy dispositions, who are not affected by any
thing, vegetate and pass their lives in a kind of tranquility, but
without pleasure or delight; like animals which see, feel, and taste
nothing, but that which is under their eyes, paws, or teeth; but the
imagination, which is proper to man, transports us beyond ourselves, and
makes us taste future and the most distant pleasures. Let us not be
told, that it makes us also foresee evils, pains, and accidents, which
will perhaps never arrive: it is seldom that imagination carries us to
these panic fears, unless it be deranged by physical causes. The sick
man sees dark phantoms, and has melancholy ideas; the man in health has
no dreams but such as are agreeable; and as we are more frequently in a
good, than a bad state of health, our natural state is to desire, to
hope, and to enjoy. It is true, that the imagination, which gives us
some agreeable moments, exposes us, when once we are undeceived, to
others which are painful. There is no person who does not wish to
preserve his life, his health, and his property; but the imagination
represents to us our life, as a thing which ought to be very long; our
health established and unchangeable; and our fortune inexhaustible: when
the two latter of these illusions cease before the former, we are much
to be pitied.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I began</span> my march
about ten o’clock.<span class = "locked">---</span>At midnight we
surprised our enemies in their camp. Never was a defeat more complete:
we killed seven hundred men; we took nine hundred prisoners; we seized
all their cannon, the military chest, and the ammunition.</p>

<p>At break of day Pulaski marched out to join me with the remainder of
the troops: he brought Lodoiska along with him: we were married in
Pulaski’s tent. All the camp resounded with songs of gladness: valour
and beauty were celebrated in joyous epithalamiums: it seemed to be the
festival of Venus and Mars; and it might be truly said, that every
soldier appeared to be impressed with the same sentiments as myself, and
that they all partook of my happiness.</p>

<p>After I had given up the first days of so dear an union entirely to
love, I&nbsp;began to think of recompensing the heroic fidelity of
Boleslas. My father-in-law presented him with one of his castles,
situate at some leagues from the capital; and Lodoiska and myself added
to this princely donation a considerable sum in ready money, on purpose
to enable him to lead an independent and tranquil life.</p>

<p>He first refused to leave us; but we commanded him to go and take
possession of his castle, and live peaceably in that honourable retreat
which his services had so amply merited. On the day of his departure I
took him aside:<span class = "locked">---</span>“You must go in my
name,” said I, “and wait upon our monarch at Warsaw: inform him that I
am united in the bonds of Hymen to the daughter of Pulaski: state to him
that I am armed on purpose to chase out of his kingdom those foreigners
who are ravaging it; and tell him, in particular, that Lovzinski,
a&nbsp;foe to the Russians, is not the enemy of his King.”</p>

<p>The recital of our operations during eight succeeding years of bloody
war would be uninteresting.<span class = "locked">---</span>Sometimes
vanquished; much oftener victorious; equally great in the midst of a
defeat, as formidable after a victory, and always superior to events,
Pulaski attracted and fixed the attention of all Europe, whom he
astonished by his long and vigorous resistance. Obliged to abandon one
province, he made incursions into, and performed new prodigies of valour
in another: and it was thus that, in marching successively throughout
all the palatinates, he signalized in each of them, by some glorious
exploit, that eternal hatred which he had sworn against the enemies of
Poland.</p>

<p>Wife of a warrior, daughter of a hero, accustomed to the tumult of a
camp, Lodoiska accompanied us every where. Of five children which she
had borne me, an only daughter alone remained to us, about eighteen
months old. One day, after a most obstinate engagement, the
<span class = "pagenum">165b</span>
victorious Russians precipitated themselves towards my tent, on purpose
to plunder it. Pulaski and myself, followed by some nobles, flew to the
defence of Lodoiska, whom we saved with difficulty: my daughter,
however, had been carried off.</p>

<p>This lovely child, by a sage precaution which her mother had wisely
made use of in those times of intestine commotion, had the arms of our
family impressed, by means of a chemical preparation, under her left
breast: but my search after my daughter has hitherto been ineffectual.
Alas! Dorliska, my dear Dorliska, either exists in slavery, or exists no
more!</p>

<p>This loss affected me with the most lively sorrow. Pulaski, however,
appeared almost insensible to my misfortunes; either because his mind
was occupied at this moment with the great project which he soon after
communicated to me, or because the miseries of his country alone could
affect his stoic heart. He, as usual, re-assembles the remains of his
army, takes possession of an advantageous post, employs several days in
fortifying, and maintains himself in it for three whole months, against
all the efforts of the Russians.</p>

<p>It, however, became at length necessary that he should abandon this
situation, as provisions were beginning to be scarce.<span class =
"locked">---</span>Pulaski, on this occasion, came to my tent; and,
having ordered every one to retire, when we alone remained, he addressed
me as follows:</p>

<p>“Lovzinski, I have just reason for complaining of your conduct.
Formerly you supported, along with me, the burden of command, and I was
enabled to divide with my son-in-law a part of my laborious avocations:
but, for these two last months, you do nothing but weep; you sigh like a
woman! You have abandoned me in a critical moment, when your assistance
was become the most necessary! You see how I am attacked on all sides;
I&nbsp;fear not for myself; I&nbsp;am not unhappy for my own life: but
if we perish, the state has no longer any defenders.</p>

<p>“Awake, Lovzinski! hew nobly you once participated in my cares! Do
not now remain the useless witness of them. We are indeed bathed in
Russian blood: our fellow citizens are avenged; but they are not saved:
nay, even in a short time we may be able no longer to defend them.”</p>

<p>“You astonish me, Pulaski! Whence these sinister auguries?”</p>

<p>“I am not alarmed without reason. Consider our present position:
I&nbsp;am forced to awaken in every heart the love of its country;
I&nbsp;have found no where but degenerate men born for slavery, or weak
ones, who, although penetrated with a sense of their own misfortunes,
have bounded all their views to barren complaints.</p>

<p>“Some true citizens are, indeed, ranged under my standards; but eight
long and bloody campaigns have lessened their number, and almost
extinguished them. I&nbsp;become enfeebled by my very
victories:&mdash;our enemies appear more numerous after their
defeats.”</p>

<p>“I repeat to you, Pulaski, once more, that you astonish me! In
circumstances no less disastrous, no less unhappy, than the present,
I&nbsp;have beheld you sustain yourself by your courage.<span class =
"word1a"> . . . . .&nbsp;</span>.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page166" id = "page166">166</a></span>
<p>“Do you think that it now abandons me? True valour does not consist
in being blind to danger, but in braving it after it has been foreseen.
Our enemies prepare for my defeat; however, if you choose, Lovzinski,
the very day which they point out for their triumph shall perhaps be
that destined to record their ruin, and achieve the safety of our
fellow-citizens!”</p>

<p>“If I choose! Can you doubt my sentiments? Speak! what would you have
done?”</p>

<p>“To strike the boldest stroke that I ever meditated! Forty chosen men
are assembled at Czenstachow along with Kaluvski, whose bravery is well
known; they want a chief, able, firm, intrepid<span class =
"locked">---</span>It is you whom I have chosen.”</p>

<p>“Pulaski, I am ready.”</p>

<p>“I will not dissemble to you the danger of the enterprize; the event
is doubtful, and, if you do not succeed, your ruin is inevitable.”</p>

<p>“I tell you that I am ready, therefore explain yourself.”</p>

<p>“You are not ignorant, that scarce four thousand men now fight under
my command: with these undoubtedly I have still an opportunity of
tormenting our enemies; but with such feeble means, I&nbsp;dare not hope
to be ever able to force them to leave our provinces. All the nobility
would flock beneath our banners, if the King were in my camp.”</p>

<p>“What do you say? Can you hope that the King would ever consent to
repair hither?”</p>

<p>“No: but he must be forced to do so.”</p>

<p>“Forced!”</p>

<p>“Yes! I know that an ancient friendship connects you with M. de
P&mdash;&mdash;: but since you have supported, along with Pulaski, the
cause of liberty, you know also that you ought to sacrifice every thing
to the good of your country; that an interest so
sacred&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know my duty, and I am ready to fulfil it; but what is it that you
now propose to me? The King never leaves Warsaw.”</p>

<p>“True; and it is, therefore, at Warsaw that you must go and find him:
it is from the heart of the capital that he must be forced.”</p>

<p>“What preparations have you made for so great an enterprise?”</p>

<p>“You behold yon Russian army, three times as strong as mine, and
which has been encamped three months in sight of us: its General,
tranquil at present within his entrenchments, impatiently waits until,
forced by famine, I&nbsp;shall surrender myself at discretion.</p>

<p>“Behind my camp are marshes which he thinks impracticable: the moment
that it is night, we shall traverse them. I&nbsp;have disposed of every
thing in such a manner that the enemy will be deceived, and not perceive
my retreat until it is too late. I&nbsp;hope therefore to be able to
steal more than an hour’s march upon them, and, if fortune seconds me,
perhaps a whole day. I&nbsp;shall advance straight forward to Warsaw by
the great road that leads to the capital, notwithstanding the efforts of
the little Russian bands who hover continually in its neighbourhood.
I&nbsp;shall either encounter and conquer these separately, or, if, they
form a junction on purpose to stop
<span class = "pagenum">166b</span>
my progress, I&nbsp;shall at least be able to occupy their attention in
such a manner that they will not be able to impede your operations.</p>

<p>“In the mean time, Lovzinski, you will have preceded me. Your forty
followers disguised, and armed only with sabres, poniards and pistols
concealed under their clothes, shall have arrived at Warsaw by different
roads. You must wait there until the King has left his palace; you are
then to carry him off, and to bring him to my camp. The enterprise is
bold<span class = "locked">---</span>rash, if you please so to term it:
the march to Warsaw is difficult; the stay in it dangerous; the return
from it extremely perilous. If you are vanquished, if you are taken
prisoner, you will perish, Lovzinski, but you will perish a martyr to
liberty! and Pulaski, jealous of so glorious an end, sighing at being
obliged to survive you, shall send Russians, thousands of Russians, to
accompany you to the tomb!</p>

<p>“But on the contrary, if an all-powerful Deity; if a God, the
protector of Poland, has inspired me with this hardy project, to
terminate her evils; if thy good fortune shall procure a success equal
to thy courage, what a glorious prosperity will be achieved by means of
this noble daring!</p>

<p>“M. de P*** will not see in my camp, other than citizen-soldiers, the
foes of foreigners, but still faithful to their king: under my patriotic
tents, he will respire, as it were, the air of liberty, and the love of
his country: the enemies of the state shall become his; our brave
nobility, ashamed of their indolence, will readily combat under the
royal banners, for the common cause; the Russians shall either be cut in
pieces, or be obliged to pass the frontiers<span class =

saviour!”<span class = "word2"> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

<p>Pulaski kept his word. That very night he accomplished his retreat,
with equal skill and success, by traversing the marshes in profound
silence. “My friend,” said my father-in-law to me, as soon as we were
out of the reach of the enemy, “it is now time that you should leave us.
I&nbsp;know well that my daughter has more courage than another woman;
but she is a tender wife, and an unfortunate mother. Her tears will
affect you, and you will lose in her embraces that strength of mind,
that dignity of soul, which now becomes more necessary to you than ever:

<h4><span class = "extended">HUMANITY</span>.</h4>

<p>As pain is what we are all naturally averse to, our own sensibility
of it should teach us to commiserate it in others, not wantonly or
unmeritedly to inflict it. But the absurd barbarity of our prejudices
and customs often leads us to transgress this rule.&mdash;When we are
under apprehension that we ourselves shall be the sufferers of pain, we
naturally shrink back at the very idea of it: we can then abominate it,
we detest it with horror; we plead hard for mercy; and we feel that
<i>we can feel</i>. But when man is out of the question, humanity
sleeps, and the heart grows callous.</p>

<h4>INSTANCE OF BENEVOLENCE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">A gentleman</span>, being
at Marseilles, hired a boat with an intention of sailing for pleasure;
he entered into conversation with the two young men who owned the
vessel, and learned, that they were not watermen by trade, but
silversmiths; and that when they could be spared from their usual
business, they employed themselves in that way to increase their
earnings. On expressing his surprise at their conduct, and imputing it
to an avaricious disposition; “Oh! sir,” said the young men, “if you
knew our reasons, you would ascribe it to a better motive. Our father,
anxious to assist his family, scraped together all he was worth;
purchased a vessel for the purpose of trading to the coast of Barbary,
but was unfortunately taken by a pirate, carried to Tripoli, and sold
for a slave. He writes word, that he is luckily fallen into the hands of
a master who treats him with great humanity; but that the sum which is
demanded for his ransom is so exorbitant, that it will be impossible for
him ever to raise it; he adds, that we must therefore relinquish all
hope of ever seeing him, and be contented, that he has as many comforts
as his situation will admit. With the hopes of restoring to his family a
beloved father, we are striving by every honest means in our power, to
collect the sum necessary for his ransom, and we are not ashamed to
employ ourselves in the occupation of watermen.” The gentleman was
struck with this account, and on his departure, made them a handsome
present.</p>

<p>Some months afterwards the young men being at work in their shop,
were greatly surprised at the sudden arrival of their father, who threw
himself into their arms; exclaiming, at the same time that he was
fearful they had taken some unjust method to raise the money for his
ransom, for it was too great a sum for them to have gained by their
ordinary occupation. They professed their ignorance of the whole affair,
and could only suspect they owed their father’s release to that
stranger, to whose generosity they had been before so much obliged.</p>

<p>After Montesquieu’s death, an account of this affair was found among
his papers, and the sum actually remitted to Tripoli for the old man’s
ransom. It is a pleasure to hear of such an act of benevolence performed
even by a person totally unknown to us; but the pleasure is infinitely
increased, when it proves the union of virtue and talents in an author
so renowned as Montesquieu<ins class = "correction"

<h4><span class = "super">RETROSPECTION</span>.</h4>

<p>Happy is it for those who have committed material errors, if they
have the inclination and opportunity of seriously reflecting and
repenting; but still more happy are those who can (as far as human
frailty will permit) look back with satisfaction on their past life, and
thus avoid the misery of bitter reflections, which is an almost
insupportable addition to the natural calamities of this world.
A&nbsp;lady once said to a pious friend, “I&nbsp;should like to die your
death, but I should not like to live your life;” meaning, that it was
too dull and insipid for her.</p>

one, who, wedded not by interest but by choice, is constant as well from
inclination as from principle; he treats his wife with delicacy as a
woman, with tenderness as a friend: he attributes her follies to her
weakness, her imprudence to her inadvertency; he passes them over
therefore with good nature, and pardons them with indulgence: all his
care and industry are employed for her welfare; all his strength and
powers are exerted for her support and protection; he is more anxious to
preserve his own character and reputation, because her’s is blended with
it: lastly, the good husband is pious and religious, that he may animate
her faith by his practice, and enforce the precepts of Christianity by
his own example: that as they join to promote each other’s happiness in
this world, they may unite together in one eternal joy and felicity in
that which is to come.</p>

submissive from choice, and obedient from inclination; what she acquires
by love and tenderness, she preserves by prudence and discretion; she
makes it her business to serve, and her pleasure to oblige her husband;
as conscious that every thing which promotes his happiness, must in the
end contribute to her own: her tenderness relieves his cares, her
affection softens his distress, her good humour and complacency lessen
and subdue his affliction; she openeth her mouth, as Solomon says, “with
wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness; she looketh well to
the ways of her husband, and eateth not the bread of idleness: her
children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth
her.” Lastly, as a good and pious Christian, she looks up with an eye of
gratitude to the great dispenser and disposer of all things, to the
husband of the widow, and father of the fatherless, intreating his
divine favour
<span class = "pagenum">169b</span>

<h4>ANECDOTE OF SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">After</span> Sir Philip
Sidney was wounded near the walls of Zetphen, the horse he rode upon
being rather furiously choleric than bravely proud, forced him to
forsake the field, but not his back, as the noblest and fittest bier to
carry a martial commander to his grave. In this sad progress, passing
along by the rest of the army, where his uncle, Robert, earl of
Leicester, the general, was, and being thirsty with excess of bleeding,
he called for drink, which was presently brought him. But, as he was
putting the bottle to his mouth, he saw a poor soldier carried along,
who had been wounded at the same time, ghastly casting up his eyes at
the bottle: sir Philip perceiving this, took it from his head, before
drinking, and delivered it to the poor man, with these words: “<span
class = "smallcaps">Thy necessity is yet greater than mine.</span>”</p>

<p>This generous behaviour of the gallant knight ought not to pass
without a penegyric. All his deeds of bravery, his politeness, his
learning, his courtly accomplishments, do not reflect so much honour
upon him, as this one disinterested and truly heroic action. It
discovered so tender and benevolent a nature: a&nbsp;mind so fortified
against pain; a&nbsp;heart so overflowing with generous sentiments to
relieve, in opposition to the violent call of his own necessities,
a&nbsp;poor man languishing in the same distress, before himself, that
none can read it without the highest admiration. Bravery is often
constitutional: fame may be the motive to seats of arms;
a&nbsp;statesman and a courtier may act from interest; but a sacrifice
so generous as this, can be made by none but those who are good as well
as great; who are noble minded, and gloriously compassionate, like
Sidney.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">His</span> resentment
against the new King remained however rankling in his heart; he did
homage to the Sovereign with visible satisfaction, and, as I suspect,
not without secret reservation, while I swore to him the oath of
allegiance, in hopes that I should soon renew it to the lawful King, who
was still concealed. My country now was delivered from the Span&mdash;sh
yoke, but my heart remained in the thraldom of love. The fetters which
it was chained with were, indeed, nothing but garlands, but nevertheless
stronger than bonds of adamant; how was it therefore to be expected,
that I should have been inclined and capable to obey my father, who
wanted me to break them? This bondage was so sweet to me, and my sharing
it with an adored woman, rendered it dearer to me than the most
unbounded liberty; it was my sole and most ardent wish to tie the bonds
by which we were united still faster. But alas! my father desired me not
to mention a syllable of a union with Amelia, and without his sanction I
durst not expect her consent! The Marquis of Ferei*a exhausted in vain
all his eloquence in order to melt the flinty heart of my inexorable
parent. In that wretched situation I sent several times for Alumbrado’s
assistance, yet I always shrunk back at the idea of owing any obligation
to that man. His first visit confirmed the remarks of the Marquis, and
all the civilities he lavished upon me, served only to strengthen my
antipathy against him. My soul was as gloomy as my exterior situation.
The view of my heaven was overdarkened by clouds which grew darker and
darker. Only one star was glimmering through the blackness of that
dismal night; one single star to which I could direct my weeping eyes.
I&nbsp;was confident that the Irishman could be no stranger to my
comfortless situation, and would aid me by his power, imagining that he
now had the best opportunity of rewarding my reliance in him, and would
undoubtedly conduct me over insurmountable obstacles to the promised
land of happiness. Meanwhile the time when my father expected my
declaration for the Princess of L*** was approaching with gigantic
strides, and the Irishman did not appear. Anxiety struggled with my
hope. I&nbsp;enquired every where for my protector, but I enquired in
vain, and my anxiety increased to black despair.</p>

discontinued, since your departure, the inquiries after your tutor,
which I began when you were here. However, I&nbsp;should undoubtedly
have continued them with the greatest prudence and activity, without
coming any nearer to the mark, if the very man whom I had been
endeavouring to find out had not spared me that fruitless talk.</p>

<p>“Yes, my friend, your tutor has personally surprised me in a most
pleasing manner. But, O! my friend, moderate your joy when reading these
lines. The meeting with that dear man was like airy vision, which
appears and vanishes again after a few moments. Your tutor came, and
went to those realms from whence no mortal can return.</p>

<p>“Five days are now elapsed, since he astonished me, one morning, by
his unexpected visit. I&nbsp;soon observed with surprise, that he
returned the manifestations of my joy with much restraint, while his
inquisitive looks were doubtfully directed at me. His relation soon
unfolded this mystery.</p>

<p>“Will you believe it, my friend, that in that very night, when we
expected him in vain with so much impatience and anxiety, he had been
taken up secretly, carried off, and imprisoned? He was on his way to my
house, when he met a carriage which he mistook for mine. In this opinion
he was confirmed, when the coachman stopt the horses, and a servant in
my livery opened the coach door for him. Two unknown gentlemen, who were
sitting in the carriage, begged him to get in, pretending to have been
sent by me to fetch him. He joined them without hesitation, and when the
coachman drove out of the town gate, instead of taking the road to my
house, he was told that one more guest was to be fetched. This pretended
guest made his appearance in the suburbs, and as soon as he had got in
the carriage, pointed a dagger at the heart of your tutor, while his two
associates seized and tied his hands. All this was effected before Count
Galvez could gain time for resistance, which would have been equally
dangerous and fruitless. He was told that if he would submit silently to
his fate, no injury should be offered him, but that he would be stabbed
without mercy if he should cry for assistance; at the same time he was
blind-folded, and after about half an hour’s ride the carriage stopped,
when your tutor was taken out of it, and conducted over several flights
of steps, through long passages, in a room where he was shut up, and
left alone.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page171" id = "page171">171</a></span>
<p>“When Count Galvez removed the bandage from his eyes, he found
himself in a spacious apartment, lighted with lamps; two smaller rooms
were on each side, but none of them had windows. Some time after his
arrival, two masked men brought him victuals and drink, which afterwards
was repeated every noon and evening. He was in want of nothing, liberty
excepted. He could not leave his apartments, which were bolted on the
outside, and having not been able to persuade his masked attendants to
answer to his questions, he could not learn where he was imprisoned. The
frequent chiming of bells, the singing of hymns, which seemed to be very
near him, and several other circumstances, made him, however, suppose
that he was confined in a cloister.</p>

<p>“It is remarkable, that during his confinement, he was obliged to sit
to a sculptor, who executed his statue so masterly, that it resembled
him in the most striking manner. The artist too was masked and nothing
could persuade him to tell for what purpose the statue was designed.</p>

<p>“At length the wished for hour of enlargement arrived. The prisoner
was called up between one and two o’clock in the morning, and ordered to
prepare for his departure. He was blindfolded and conducted to the
street, where he was placed in a coach, and threatened with instant
death if he should dare to utter a syllable. After half an hour’s ride
he was taken out of the coach, upon which, his conductors drove away at
a furious rate. As soon as he perceived that he was alone, he removed
the bandage from his eyes, and found himself in a lonely part of the
suburbs, and with the first dawn of day called at my house.</p>

<p>“As soon as Count Galvez had finished his extraordinary tale,
I&nbsp;summoned my servants, in order to clear myself from a suspicion
which afflicted me severely, and examined them rigorously in his
presence. It was, however, proved that my horses and carriages, as well
as my servants, had been at home at the hour when the Count was carried
off, which rendered it very probable that the <i>Unknown</i> must have
imitated my equipage and livery, in order to ensnare the Count with
greater ease.</p>

<p>“Your tutor enquired much, and with great affection after you:
I&nbsp;told him as much as I knew, but he was not satisfied with it. The
following morning he departed for Lisb*n, in hopes of meeting you there,
after a long and painful separation. I&nbsp;rode on horseback by his
carriage in order to accompany him a few miles; the impatient desire of
seeing you soon made your tutor urge the postillion to press his horses
onward; the fellow was offended at the incessant solicitations of the
Count, and drove slower, which vexed our friend to such a degree, that
he exhorted the postillion rather warmly to proceed faster, adding some
menaces. The postillion being provoked by your tutor’s threats, whipped
his horses furiously, without taking proper notice of the neighbourhood
of the precipice, which you will recollect; the animals grew wild, and
the carriage was precipitated into the abyss. The Count scarcely
breathed, when he received assistance, and the postillion was dashed to
pieces against the rocks.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">171b</span>
<p>“I ordered instantly all possible care to be taken of our friend;
however, a&nbsp;violent vomiting of blood, the consequence of a
contusion on his breast, put an end to his life the subsequent day.
A&nbsp;few minutes before his death, he wrote the following note, but
was soon interrupted by a fainting fit.</p>

<p>“‘Ere while we were separated by men, but now we are going to be
disunited by God. I&nbsp;do not murmur; yet I should have been happy to
see you once more. On the brink of eternity I am expanding my hands,
blessing thee, excellent young man! Weep not at my death; we shall meet
again in yon blissful mansions, where all good men shall be reunited for
ever. Honour my memory by keeping firm to my principles, which from my
soul, flowed over in your mind<ins class = "correction"

<p>Two mortal wounds like those which the ill-fated love affair, and the
death of Count Galvez inflicted on the heart of my friend, confined him
to a sick bed. Now happened what I had dreaded, without my having been
able to prevent it. Alumbrado, who was returned from his journey,
intruded on my friend, and soon traced out the safest road to his heart.
My friend was weak enough to communicate to him the situation in which
he was with regard to Amelia; and Alumbrado hesitated not a moment to
procure him the consent of his father. The power exercised by that man
over the Marquis was so great, that the latter suffered himself to be
persuaded to write to the Countess, and to invite her in the most
honourable and flattering manner, to render his son happy by giving him
her hand.</p>

<h4><span class = "extended">ON HYPOCRISY</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Mr. Addison</span>
somewhere observes, that hypocrisy at the fashionable end of the town,
is very different from hypocrisy in the city. The fashionable hypocrite
endeavours to appear more vicious than he really is; the other kind of
hypocrite more virtuous. The former is afraid of every thing that has a
shew of religion in it, and would be thought engaged in any criminal
gallantries and amours, of which he is not guilty. The latter assumes a
face of sanctity, and covers a multitude of vices, under a seemingly
religious deportment. There is a third sort of hypocrites, who not only
deceive the world, but very often impose upon themselves. These
different kinds of hypocrisy cannot be too much detested. The first is a
flagrant depravity of mind, which induces a man to prefer the appearance
of vice to virtue, and despicable to an amiable character. The second
disgraces and abuses virtue by assuming her resemblance; the last,
though not more criminal, is more dangerous than either of the former,
as it is accompanied with mental blindness, and self deception.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Glicera</span> was
beautiful and poor. Scarce had she numbered sixteen springs, when she
lost the mother who had brought her up. Reduced to servitude, she kept
the flocks of Lamon, who cultivated the lands of a rich citizen of
Mitylene.</p>

<p>One day, her eyes flowing with tears, she went to visit her mother’s
solitary tomb. She poured upon her grave a cup of pure water, and
suspended crowns of flowers to the branches of the bushes she had
planted round it. Seated beneath the <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘mourful’">mournful</ins> shade, and drying up her tears, she
said, ‘O&nbsp;thou most tender of mothers, how dear to my heart is the
remembrance of thy virtues! If ever I forget the instructions thou
gavest me, with such a tranquil smile, in that fatal moment, when
inclining thy head upon my bosom, I&nbsp;saw thee expire; if ever I
forget them! may the propitious Gods forsake me, and may thy sacred
shade forever fly me! It is thou that hast just preserved my innocence.
I&nbsp;come to tell thy manes all. Wretch that I am! Is there any one on
earth to whom I dare open my heart?</p>

<p>‘Nicias, the Lord of this country, came hither to enjoy the pleasures
of the autumn. He saw me; he regarded me with a soft and gracious air.
He praised my flocks, and the care I took of them: he often told me that
I was genteel, and made me presents. Gods! how was I deceived! but in
the country who mistrusts? I&nbsp;said to myself, how kind our master
is! may the Gods reward him! all my vows shall be for him; ’tis all that
I can do; but I will forever do it. The rich are happy, and favoured by
the immortals. When bountiful, like Nicias, they deserve to be happy.
This to myself I said, and let him take my hand, and press it in his.
The other day I blushed, and dared not look up, when he put a gold ring
upon my finger. See, he said, what is engraved on this stone?
A&nbsp;winged child, who smiles like thee; and ’tis he that must make
thee happy. As he spoke these words, he stroaked my cheeks, that were
redder than the fire. He loves me; he has the tenderness of a father for
me; how have I deserved so much kindness from a Lord, and so rich and
powerful? O, my mother, that was all thy poor child thought. Heavens!
how was I deceived! this morning he found me in the orchard; he chuck’d
me familiarly under the chin. Come, he said, bring me some new-blown
flowers to the myrtle bower, that I may there enjoy their sweet
perfumes. With haste I chose the finest flowers; and, full of joy,
I&nbsp;ran to the bower. Thou art, he said, more nimble than the
Zephyrs, and more beautiful than the Goddess of flowers. Then, immortal
Gods! I&nbsp;yet tremble at the thought; then he catch’d me in his arms,
and pressed me to his bosom, and all that love can promise, all that is
soft and seducing, flow’d from his lips. I&nbsp;wept; I&nbsp;trembled.
Unable to resist such arts, I&nbsp;had been forever lost. No, thou
wou’dst no longer have had a child, if thy remembrance had not watch’d
over my heart. Ah! if thy worthy mother had even seen thee suffer such
disgraceful caresses! that thought alone gave
<span class = "pagenum">172b</span>
me power to force myself from the arms of the seducer and fly.</p>

<p>‘Now I come; O with what comfort is it that I still dare! I come to
weep over thy grave. Alas! poor and unfortunate as I am, why did I lose
thee when so young. I&nbsp;droop like a flower, deprived of the support
that sustain’d its feeble stalk. This cup of pure water I pour to the
honour of thy manes. Accept this garland! receive my tears! may they
penetrate even to thy ashes! Hear, O&nbsp;my mother, hear; ’tis to thy
dear remains, that repose beneath those flowers, which my eyes have so
often bedewed: ’tis to thy sacred shade I here renew the vows of my
heart. Virtue, innocence, and the fear of the Gods, shall make the
happiness of my days. Therefore poverty shall never disturb the serenity
of my mind. May I do nothing that thou wou’dst not have approv’d with a
smile of tenderness, and I shall surely be, as thou wast, belov’d of
Gods and men: For I shall be gentle, modest, and industrious, O&nbsp;my
mother, by living thus, I&nbsp;hope to die like thee, with smiles and
tears of joy.’</p>

<p>Glicera, on quitting the place, felt all the powerful charms of
virtue. The gentle warmth that was diffused over her mind, sparkled in
her eyes, still wet with tears. She was beautiful as those days of
spring, when the sun shines through a transient shower.</p>

<p>With a mind quite tranquil, she was hastening back to her labour,
when Nicias ran to meet her. ‘O&nbsp;Glicera!’ he said, and tears flowed
down his cheeks, ‘I&nbsp;have heard thee at thy mother’s tomb. Fear
nothing, virtuous maid! I&nbsp;thank the immortal Gods! I&nbsp;thank
that virtue, which hath preserved me from the crime of seducing thy
innocence. Forgive me, chaste Glicera! forgive, nor dread in me a fresh
offence. My virtue triumphs through thine. Be wise, be virtuous, and be
ever happy. That meadow surrounded with trees, near to thy mother’s
tomb, and half the flock thou keepest, are thine.</p>

<p>‘May a man of equal virtue complete the happiness of thy days! weep
not, virtuous maid! but accept the present I offer thee with a sincere
heart, and suffer me from henceforth to watch over thy happiness. If
thou refusest me, a&nbsp;remorse for offending thy virtue will be the
torment of all my days. Forget, O&nbsp;vouchsafe to forget my crime, and
I will revere thee as a propitious power that hath defended me against
myself.’</p>

(Continued from <a href = "#page166">page 166</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Pulaski</span> pressed me,
but in vain, for I was unable to consent. As soon as Lodoiska knew that
I should depart alone, and perceived that we were resolved not to inform
her whither, she shed torrents of tears, and strove to detain me.
I&nbsp;began to hesitate.</p>

<p>Lovzinski, cries my father-in-law at this critical moment, Lovzinski,
depart! Wife, children, relations, all ought to be sacrificed, when it
is necessary for the salvation of your country.</p>

<p>I instantly mount my horse, and make such haste, that I arrive by the
middle of next day at Czenstachow. I&nbsp;here found forty brave men
waiting for me, and determined for the most hazardous enterprise.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said I to them, “we are now met on purpose to carry a
king out of the midst of his own capital. Those capable of attempting
such a bold enterprise, are alone capable of effecting it: either
success or death awaits on&nbsp;us!”</p>

<p>After this short harangue we prepare to depart. Kaluvski, forewarned
of our design, had already procured twelve waggons, loaded with hay and
straw, each of which was drawn by four good horses.</p>

<p>We instantly disguise ourselves as peasants; we hide our clothes, our
sabres, our pistols, and the saddles of our horses, in the hay with
which our waggons were partly filled; we agree upon certain signs, and I
give them a <i>watch-word</i>, to be used according to
circumstances.&mdash;Twelve of the conspirators, commanded by Kaluvski,
enter into Warsaw, accompanied by as many waggons, which they themselves
conduct. I&nbsp;divide the rest of my little troop into several
brigades, on purpose to avert suspicion: each is ordered to march at
some distance from the other, and to gain the capital by different
gates.</p>

<p>We depart, and on Saturday the 2d of November, 1771, arrive at
Warsaw, and lodge together at a convent belonging to the Dominicans.</p>

<p>On the next day, which was Sunday, and which will for ever form a
memorable epoch in the annals of Poland, one of my people of the name of
Stravinski, being covered with rags, places himself near the collegiate
church, and soon after proceeds demanding charity even at the gates of
the royal palace, where he observes every thing that passed. Several of
the conspirators walked up and down the six narrow streets, in the
neighbourhood of the great square, where Kaluvski and myself were
posted. We remain in ambuscade during the whole day, and part of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>At six o’clock at night the king leaves the palace; he is followed,
and is seen to enter the hotel of his uncle, the grand chancellor of
Lithuania.</p>

<p>All our followers receive notice of this event, and assemble
<span class = "pagenum">173b</span>
instantly: they throw off their miserable clothes, saddle their horses,
and prepare their arms, in the large square belonging to the convent,
where their movements are entirely concealed. They then sally forth, one
after the other, under favour of the night. Too well known in Warsaw to
hazard appearing there, without disguising my self, I&nbsp;still wear my
peasant’s dress, and I mount an excellent horse, caparisoned, however,
after the common manner.</p>

<p>I then point out my followers the different posts in the suburbs,
which I had assigned them before our departure from the convent, and
they were dispersed in such a manner, that all the avenues to the palace
of the grand chancellor were carefully and strictly guarded.</p>

<p>Between nine and ten o’clock at night, the king comes forth on
purpose to return home; and we remark, with joy, that his attendants
were far from being numerous.</p>

<p>The carriage was preceded by two men, who carried <i>flambeaux</i>,
some officers of his suit, two gentlemen and an esquire followed.
I&nbsp;know not what was the name of the grandee in the coach along with
the king. There were two pages, one to each door, two haydukes running
by the side of the equipage, and three footmen, in the royal livery
behind.</p>

<p>The king proceeds slowly: part of my people assemble at some
distance; twelve of the most determined spring forward: I&nbsp;put
myself at their head, and we advance at a good pace.</p>

<p>As there was a Russian garrison at that very moment in Warsaw, we
affect to speak the language of those foreigners, so that our petty
troop might be mistaken for one of their patroles.</p>

<p>We overtake the carriage at about a hundred and fifty paces from the
grand chancellor’s palace, and exactly between those of the bishop of
Cracow and of the late grand general of Poland.</p>

<p>All of a sudden we pass the heads of the foremost horses, so that
those who preceded, found themselves separated from those who surrounded
the royal equipage.</p>

<p>I instantly give the signal agreed upon. Kaluvski gallops up, with
the remainder of the conspirators: I&nbsp;present a pistol to the
postillion, who instantly stops; the coachman is fired upon, and
precipitated beneath the wheels. Of the two haydukes who endeavoured to
defend their prince, one drops, pierced with two balls; the other is
overturned by means of a backhanded stroke from a sabre, which he
receives on the head; the steed belonging to the esquire falls down
covered with wounds; one of the pages is dismounted, and his horse
taken; pistol-balls fly about in all directions&mdash;in short, the
attack was so hot, and the fire so violent, that I trembled for the
king’s life.</p>

<p>He himself, however, preserving the utmost coolness in the midst of
the danger, had now descended from his carriage, and was striving to
regain his uncle’s palace on foot. Kaluvski arrests and seizes him by
the hair; seven or eight of the conspirators surround, disarm, overpower
him, and, pressing him between their horses, make off at a full gallop
towards the end of the street.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page174" id = "page174">174</a></span>
<p>During this moment, I confess that I thought Pulaski had basely
deceived me; that the death of the monarch was resolved upon, and that a
plot had been formed to assassinate him.</p>

<p>All of a sudden I form my resolves; I clap spurs to my horse,
overtake the little band, cry out to them to stop, and threaten to kill
the first person who should dare to disobey&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>That God who is the protector of good kings, watched over the safety
of M. de P***! Kaluvski and his followers stop at the sound of my
well-known voice. We mount the king on horseback, make off at full
speed, and regain the ditch that surrounded the city, which the monarch
is constrained to leap, in company with&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>At that moment a panic terror takes possession of my troop; at fifty
paces distant from the ramparts, there were no more than seven who
surrounded the person of the king.</p>

<p>The night was dark and rainy, and it was necessary to dismount every
instant, on purpose to sound the morass with which we were
surrounded.</p>

<p>The horse on which the monarch rode fell twice, and broke his leg at
the second fall: during these violent movements, his majesty lost his
<i>pelisse</i>, and the shoe belonging to his left foot.</p>

<p>“If you wish that I should follow you,” says he to us, you must
furnish me with another horse and a pair of boots.</p>

<p>We remount him once more, and, on purpose to gain the road by which
Pulaski had promised me to advance, we resolve to pass through a village
called Burakow; but the king exclaims, “Do not go that way; there are
Russians there!”</p>

<p>I immediately change our <i>route</i>; but in proportion as we
advance through the wood of Beliany, our number continues to diminish.
In a short time, I&nbsp;perceive nobody around me but Kaluvski and
Stravinski: a&nbsp;few minutes after, we are challenged by a Russian
sentinel on horseback, at whose voice we instantly stop, greatly alarmed
for our safety.</p>

<p>“Let us kill him!” cries the ferocious Kaluvski, pointing to the
king. I&nbsp;instantly avow to him, without disguise, the horror which
such a proposition inspired me with. “Very well, you may then take upon
you the task of conducting him<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">,”&nbsp;</ins>adds this cruel hearted man, who
immediately after precipitates himself into the woods. Stravinski
follows him, and I alone remain with the king.</p>

<p>“Lovzinski,” says he, addressing himself to me, as soon as they were
out of sight; “it is you, I&nbsp;can no longer doubt it; it is you, for
I <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for well?">will</ins> remember your voice!” I&nbsp;utter not a single word
in reply. He then mildly adds, “It is certainly you Lovzinski! Who would
have thought this ten years ago?”</p>

<p>We find ourselves at that moment near to the convent of Beliany,
distant no more than a single league from Warsaw.</p>

<p>“Lovzinski,” continues the king, “permit me to enter this convent,
and save yourself.”</p>

<p>“You must follow me,” was my only answer.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">174b</span>
<p>“It is in vain,” rejoins the monarch, “that you are disguised; it is
in vain that you endeavour to assume a feigned voice: I&nbsp;know you
well, I&nbsp;am fully assured that you are Lovzinski: ah, who would have
said so ten years since? You would then have lost your life, on
condition of preserving that of your friend.”</p>

<p>His majesty now ceases to speak; we advance some time, in profound
silence, which he again breaking, exclaims. “I&nbsp;am overcome with
fatigue&mdash;<i>if you wish to carry me alive, permit me to repose
myself for a single moment</i>.”</p>

<h4>ANECDOTE OF CÆSARE ARETHUSI.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Cæsare</span> Arethusi, was
invited by the duke of Ferrara, to visit his court, and received there
with extraordinary respect. That prince sat to him for his portrait,
admired the performance highly, gave him evident proofs not only of his
favour, but of his friendship and esteem; and having, at last, concluded
that his generous treatment must inevitably have secured his gratitude
(if not his affection) he freely acquainted him with his real inducement
for inviting him to Ferrara. Confiding in the integrity of the painter,
he told him there was a lady in the city whose portrait he wished to
possess; but that it was to be procured in a manner so secret, as
neither to be suspected by the lady herself, nor any of her friends. He
promised an immense reward to Arethusi, if he was successful and
retentive; he threatened him with the utmost severity of his resentment,
if ever he suffered the secret to transpire.</p>

<p>The artist watched a proper opportunity to sketch the likeness of the
lady, unnoticed by any; and having shewn it to the duke, he seemed
exceedingly struck with the resemblance, as well as the graceful air of
the figure, and ordered Arethusi to paint a portrait from that sketch,
as delicately as he possibly could, but, above all things, recommended
it to him, to keep it from every eye except his own.</p>

<p>When the picture was finished, the painter himself beheld it with
admiration, and thought it would be injurious to his fame to conceal
from the world, a&nbsp;performance which he accounted perfect; and

<h4>ON THE ORIGIN OF LOVE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Helvetius</span>, who has
scrutinised the effects of first impressions, with an acuteness which
few of our moral philosophers can boast, led me, the other day, to
consider on his theory, the origin of those refined and delicate
sensations, which, in the mutual attachment of the sexes, give birth to
the choicest blessings of humanity. According to his way of reasoning,
I&nbsp;should suppose our ideas of beauty, and those expressions of the
countenance which captivate the heart, should be ascribed to the
earliest impressions on the mind. Every one’s experience will suggest to
him the proof of this assertion. The first impression I can recollect
when my eyes opened upon this world, was the sight of a beautiful
mother, who hung over me with looks of the most fervent love.
A&nbsp;face like hers, to me therefore, naturally became the most
agreeable object in nature: And it must be to some secret analogy of
feature that I owe that delirium of love, which I have since experienced
from the charms of a mistress, whose countenance bore all those striking
expressions of tenderness which characterised hers.</p>

<p>So much for the definition.---I cannot but add, how truly deplorable
it is, that a passion which constitutes almost the only honourable
<i>trait</i> in human nature, should now be every where trampled upon by
avarice. For my part, altho’ I&nbsp;have suffered more from the
<i>fancied</i> than ever I shall probably again from the real preference
of a wealthy rival, yet, I&nbsp;trust I shall not witness, as our
country advances, the same instances of legal prostitution as I have
done in some other parts of the world. With us it is still more
unpardonable; as the means of bettering our fortunes are so much more
easy or certain. If there are those who are so far insensible to the
refinements of sentiment as to give a preference to those enjoyments
which are to be purchased, let them recollect, that by renouncing an
union of the same taste and disposition, they abandon the only hope they
can confidently entertain of nuptial constancy and domestic sunshine. If
any one objects to me, that I may frequently be mistaken in this result
of sincere love, I&nbsp;should still exclaim</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">No</span> object can be
more pleasing to a virtuous mind, than to behold a well-directed
benevolence, productive of a grateful and happy heart; while the smiling
scenes of cultivation and society succeed to the solitary wastes of
savage nature. Mr. Wood, a&nbsp;free merchant of Decca, coming thence to
Calcutta, where the Ganges flows thro’ vast tracks of uncultivated and
marshy woods, which render the navigation peculiarly difficult and
dangerous, happened to fall in with a poor native wood-cutter. In the
course of conversation, the latter said, that if he had but fifty rupees
(5l.) he could make a comfortable settlement. The fifty rupees Mr. Wood
lent him. When this worthy man, after staying some time at Calcutta,
returned to Decca, he saw the pleasing effects of his bounty in an
advanced settlement, on a small eminence newly cleared from standing
trees. Unsolicited, he lent the wood-cutter fifty rupees more. The next
voyage, Mr. Wood was delighted to behold the rapid progress of the
settlement, and astonished to meet the wood-cutter offering to pay half
the small, but generous loan. Mr. Wood refused to receive it at that
time, and lent him 100 rupees more. About eighteen months after the
commencement of the settlement, he had the inexpressible satisfaction of
seeing his industrious wood-cutter at the head of five populous
villages, and a spacious tract of fine land under cultivation, drained
and cleared of swamps and woods. The woodcutter now repaid the principal
he had borrowed, and tendered the interest, while tears of gratitude and
humble affection stole down his venerable, his happy and expressive
countenance. But how inexpressible the feelings of the benevolent
merchant! Let those plunderers, who return with the wealth of nations

<h4 class = "smallcaps">Extraordinary Intrepidity of the
Jomsburgians.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">History</span> informs us,
that Harold, surnamed Blaatand, or Blue Tooth, (a&nbsp;king of Denmark,
who reigned in the middle of the tenth century) had founded on the coast
of Pomerania, which he had subdued, a&nbsp;city named Julin or Jomsburg;
where he sent a colony of young Danes, and bestowed the government on a
celebrated warrior named Palnatoko. This new Lycurgus had made of that
city a second Sparta, and every thing was directed to this single end,
to form complete soldiers. The author who has left us the history of
this colony, assures us, that “it was forbidden them so much as to
mention the name of fear, even in the most imminent dangers.” No citizen
of Jomsburg was to yield to any number, however great, but to fight
intrepidly without flying, even from a very superior force. The sight of
present and inevitable death would have been no excuse with them for
making any the least complaint, or for shewing the slightest
apprehension. And this legislator really appears to have eradicated from
the minds of most of the youths bred up under him, all traces of that
sentiment so natural and so universal, which makes men think on their
destruction with horror. Nothing can shew this better than a single fact
in their history, which deserves to have place here for its singularity.
Some of them having made an irruption into the territories of a powerful
Norwegian lord, named Haquin, were overcome in spite of the obstinacy of
their resistance; and the most distinguished among them being made
prisoners, were, according to the custom of those times, condemned to
death. The news of this, far from afflicting them, was, on the contrary,
received with joy. The first who was led to punishment was content to
say, without changing countenance, “why should not the same happen to me
as did to my father? he died, and so must I.” A&nbsp;warrior named
Thorchill, who was to cut off the head of the second, having asked him
what he felt at the sight of death, he answered, “that he remembered too
well the laws of Jomsburg to utter any words that denoted fear.” The
third, in reply to the same question, said, “he rejoiced to die in
glory, and that he preferred such a death to an infamous
<span class = "pagenum">177b</span>
life like that of Thorchill’s.” The fourth made an answer much longer
and more extraordinary. “I&nbsp;suffer with a good heart; and the
present hour is to me very agreeable. I&nbsp;only beg of you,” added he,
addressing himself to Thorchill, “to be very quick in cutting off my
head; for it is a question often debated by us at Jomsburg, whether one
retains any sense after being beheaded. I&nbsp;will therefore grasp this
knife in my hand; if, after my head is cut off, I&nbsp;strike it towards
you, it will shew I have not lost all sense; if I let it drop, it will
be a proof to the contrary. Make haste, therefore, and decide the
dispute.” ‘Thorchill, adds the historian, cut off his head in the most
expeditious manner, but the knife, as might be expected, dropped from
his hand.’ The fifth shewed the same tranquility, and died rallying and
jeering his enemies. The sixth begged of Thorchill that he might not be
led to punishment like a sheep; “strike the blow in my face,” said he,
“I&nbsp;will sit still without shrinking; and take notice whether I once
wink my eyes or betray one sign of fear in my countenance. For we
inhabitants of Jomsburg are used to exercise ourselves in trials of this
sort, so as to meet the stroke of death without once moving.” He kept
his promise before all the spectators, and received the blow without the
least sign of fear, or so much as winking his eyes. The seventh, says
the historian, was a very beautiful young man, in the flower of his age.
His long fair hair, as fine as silk, floated in curls and ringlets on
his shoulders. Thorchill asked him what he thought of death?
“I&nbsp;receive it willingly,” said he, “since I have fulfilled the
greatest duty of life, and have seen all those put to death whom I would
not survive. I&nbsp;only beg of you one favour, not to let my hair be
touched by a slave, or stained with my blood.”</p>

<p>“O! that this letter could fly on the pinions of love, in order to
carry instantly to my friend health and joy. Yes, your request is
granted. Receive, my dearest Duke, to whom my <span class =

genius of love, will conduct me on my voyage, will assist me to conquer
my fear of the sea. I&nbsp;should never have done writing if this letter
did not require expedition, and my friend, who arrived here the day
before yesterday, insisted upon adding a few words to those&nbsp;of</p>

<p class = "center">“Your</p>

<p class = "right smallcaps">“Amelia Clairval.”</p>

<p>“Give me leave, my Lord, to add only my sincerest congratulations,

soothsayer</p>

<p class = "center">“Your humble and obedient servant,</p>

<p class = "right smallcaps">Anna de Delier.”</p>

<p>The Duke had begun to mend rapidly ever since the Marquis consented
to his union with Amelia; the letter of the Countess restored his health
entirely. No mortal could be more happy and cheerful than the Duke of
Cami*a. It was natural that Alumbrado, who, as the author of his
happiness, had no small claim to his gratitude, should acquire in his
eyes a value, which entirely dispelled the antipathy he at first had
conceived against him. I&nbsp;soon was made sensible of that change,
when I took one time the opportunity of dropping a few words concerning
Alumbrado. “I&nbsp;cannot conceive,” the Duke replied warmly, “why you
are so much prejudiced against that man; it is true his physiognomy does
not speak much in his recommendation; it is, however, very
unphilosophical to condemn a person merely on account of his features.”
“Say whatever you will,” I&nbsp;replied, “an undescribable repelling
sensation, which certainly does not deceive me&mdash;” “You have
conceived an antipathy against him,” the Duke interrupted me, “and that
cannot be refuted by arguments; however, I&nbsp;will
<span class = "pagenum">178b</span>
remind you of a fact, which here will be in <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘is’">its</ins> proper place. Socrates, whose
physiognomy, as you will recollect, was very much to his disadvantage,
happened once to be in a company of friends, when a philosopher, who
pretended to be a physiognomist, took the word; he was requested to
delineate the character of Socrates, who was a stranger to him. The
philosopher named several vices which he pretended to read plainly in
his face. A&nbsp;general laughter was the effect of his judgment;
however, Socrates remained serious, and declared that he really had felt
a natural propensity to those vices, but had got the better of it by
unremitted assiduity. The application of this instance, I&nbsp;leave to
your own good sense.”</p>

<p>“How?” I exclaimed with surprise, “you compare Alumbrado with
Socrates, an absurd ascetic with a reverend sage, hypocrisy with
virtue?” This enormous infatuation vexed me to such a degree, that I
could not help giving vent to my just resentment. However,
I&nbsp;perceived soon that my words did not make the least impression on
my misguided friend. Being therefore obliged to desist from my
endeavours to change the opinion of the Duke, I&nbsp;strove with
additional assiduity to cut off his connection with Alumbrado, at least
till he should be united to Amelia, expecting that this angel would soon
drive away that demon of darkness. I&nbsp;proposed to the Duke a journey
to **ina, for the benefit of his health, and offered to accompany him.
He consented to it without difficulty, expecting to beguile by exercise
and diversions, the time which, from his impatience of seeing Amelia
arrive, appeared to him to creep on with snail-like slowness. My aim
would however have been attained without this expedient, Alumbrado
leaving Li*bon unexpectedly; yet we set out on our proposed journey.</p>

<p>We had not been seven days at **ina when the Duke was already
impatient to leave that place. However improbable it was Amelia could
arrive so soon, yet this idea left him no rest. We returned on the
eighth day, and travelled day and night.</p>

<p>It was five o’clock in the morning, when we alighted at his palace.
Scarcely had we entered his apartment when his Secretary brought a
letter which he said had been left by a pilot at a late hour last night.
The Duke reddened and grew pale alternately, while he opened it.<span
class = "locked">---</span>“She is arrived, she is arrived!” he
exclaimed, and the letter dropped out of his hand trembling with
rapture. “She is arrived!” he repeated, taking it up and re-perusing the
gladful lines. The emotions of his mind were so violent, that he was
obliged to sit down. “Amelia is arrived!” he exclaimed again, rising and
straining me to his bosom. The letter was couched in the following
words:</p>

<p>“Has not your heart told you, my dearest Duke that I am near you?
I&nbsp;should already have pressed you to my panting heart, if the

<p>“Well, my friend,” said the Duke, when I returned the paper to him,
“has my presentiment deceived me? have not I done well to urge our
return?&mdash;But why do we tarry here? (he added) let us fly to the
harbour!”</p>

<p>The horses were instantly saddled, and we mounted them in our
travelling dress. We rode in full speed, and each of us indulged
silently his sentiments.&mdash;The sky was gloomy, and the universal
stillness, not interrupted by the least breeze of air, seemed to presage
no good. At length we fancied, with astonishment, we heard the distant
rolling of thunder; however we soon perceived that it was the echo
caused by the report of guns. The distant firing of cannon, and the
forerunners of a rising tempest, thrilled my heart with chilling
anxiety, for I apprehended the ship must be in great danger. Soon after
the firing ceased, but this calm was more dreadful to me than the report
of the cannon. We spurred our horses, without uttering a word, for
neither of us dared to confess his apprehensions. Being at length
arrived at the sea shore<span class = "locked">---</span>Heavens! what a
scene of horror did we behold! the surge was dreadful, the cliffs and
the strand were covered with a white spume. The rays of the sun could
not penetrate the fog which overspread the surface of the sea. We could,
therefore, not discover the island where the ship was lying at anchor,
it appearing to us in the shape of a black cloud, which seemed to be a
mile distant from the shore. The veil which concealed the danger of the
ship from our eyes only served to augment our anxiety.</p>

<p>A troop of mariners and soldiers under the command of Men*os, were
arrived with us at the shore. The drums beat, and a general volley was
fired. A&nbsp;flash of lightning darted instantly over the sea, and
immediately after it the report of a gun was heard. We all hastened to
the side where we had perceived the signal, and observed, through the
fog, the body and the main-yard of a large ship. We were so near that we
could hear the whistling and the acclamations of the sailors, in spite
of the roaring of the mountainous billows. The ship’s crew fired a gun
every three minutes, as soon as they perceived that assistance was
near.</p>

<p>I admired my friend’s firmness of mind with which he, at a sight that
ought to have rendered him almost distracted, shewed the greatest zeal
to save the crew, ordering a large fire to be lighted on the cliffs, and
boards, cables, empty casks and provisions to be kept in readiness.</p>

<p>An impending hurricane seemed to be lurking in the air. The middle of
the clouds was of a horrid blackness, and their edges were of a copper
colour. The leaves of the trees were moving, and yet not a breath of air
was felt. The cries of the sea fowls, who were resorting to the island
for protection, resounded through the air.</p>

<p>At length we heard suddenly a dreadful roaring, as if foaming
torrents were rushing down from the summit of a lofty mountain, and
every one exclaimed, this is the hurricane! In the same moment a violent
whirlwind removed the foggy veil which had concealed the island from our
eyes. We had now a clear view of the ship; her whole deck was covered
with people, her colours were hoisted, her fore-part was secured by four
anchors, and
<span class = "pagenum">179b</span>
her stern by one. Her stem opposed the billowing waves which came
roaring from the sea, and was raised so high above the surface of the
water, that one could see her whole keel, while the stern was almost
entirely buried in the foaming billows. The dangerous situation of the
vessel rendered it impossible for her to put out to sea, or to run on
store.</p>

<p>The howling of the wind, and the roaring of the waves, which were
swelling higher every moment, was dreadful. The whole channel between
the island and the shore was a mass of white thick froth, cut through by
black and hollow waves. The appearance of the horizon prognosticated a
long lasting storm. Some waves of a dreadful shape separated from the
main every now and then, and darted with the velocity of lightning
across the channel, while others remained immoveable like enormous
rocks. Not one blue spot could be descried in the firmament; a&nbsp;pale
faint glimmer enlightened heaven, earth and sea.</p>

<h4>INSTANCE OF UNCOMMON FRIENDSHIP.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Two</span> Jewish soldiers,
in the time of <i>Vespasian</i>, had made many campaigns together; and a
participation of dangers, at length, bred an union of hearts. They were
remarked throughout the whole army, as the two friendly brothers; they
felt and fought for each other.&mdash;Their friendship might have
continued, without interruption, till death, had not the good fortune of
the one alarmed the pride of the other, which was in his promotion to be
a centurion under the famous <i>John</i>, who headed a particular party
of the Jewish male-contents.</p>

<p>From this moment their former love was converted into the most
inveterate enmity. They attached themselves to opposite factions, and
sought each other’s lives in the conflict of adverse party. In this
manner they continued for more than two years, vowing mutual revenge,
and animated with an unconquerable spirit of aversion. At length,
however, that party of the <i>Jews</i>, to which the mean soldier
belonged, joining with the <i>Romans</i>, it became victorious, and
drove <i>John</i>, with all his adherents, into the temple. History has
given us more than one picture of the dreadful conflagration of that
superb edifice. The <i>Roman</i> soldiers were gathered round it; the
whole temple was in flames, and thousands were seen amidst them, within
its sacred circuit. It was in this situation of things, that the
now-successful soldier saw his former friend upon the battlements of the
highest tower, looking round with horror, and just ready to be consumed
with flames. All his former tenderness now returned; he saw the man of
his bosom just going to perish; and, unable to withstand the impulse, he
ran spreading his arms, and crying out to his friend, to leap down from
the top, and find safety with him. The Centurion from above heard and
obeyed; and, casting himself from the top of the tower, into his
fellow-soldier’s arms, both fell a sacrifice on the spot; one being
crushed to death by the weight of his companion, and the other dashed to
pieces by the greatness of his fall.</p>

<h4>HISTORY OF THE BEARD.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> respect which
has been shewn to the Beard in all parts of the civilized, and in some
parts of the uncivilized world, is well known to the slightest
erudition; nay, a&nbsp;certain prejudice in its favour still exists,
even in countries where the razor has long been omnipotent. This
impression seems to arise very naturally from the habit of associating
with it those ideas of experience and wisdom of which it is the emblem.
It cannot wait upon the follies of youth; its bushy and descending
honours are not known to grace the countenance of early life; and tho’
it may be said, in some degree, to grow with our growth, and strengthen
with our strength, it continues to flourish in our decline, and attains
its most honourable form and beauty when the knees tremble, the voice
grows shrill, and the pate is bare.</p>

<p>When the bold and almost blasphemous pencil of the enthusiastic
painter has aimed at representing the Creator of the world upon the
canvass, a&nbsp;flowing beard has ever been one of the characteristic
and essential marks of the Supreme Divinity. The Pagan Jupiter, and the
graver inhabitants of Olympus, would not be known without this majestic
ornament. Philosophy, till our smock faced days, has considered it as
the appropriate symbol of its profession. Judaic Superstition, Egyptian
Wisdom, Attic Elegance, and Roman Virtue, has been its fond protectors.
To make it an object of dissention, and alternately to consider it as a
sign of orthodoxy or the standard of heresy, was reserved for the
fantastical zeal of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>In more modern times, not only provincial and national, but general
Councils have been convened, Synods have been summoned, ecclesiastical
Congregations and cloistered Chapters of every denomination have been
assembled, to consider, at different periods, the character of this
venerable <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for growth?">grown</ins> of the human visage. Infinite disputes have been,
of course, engendered, sometimes with respect to its form, at other
times with regard to its existence. Religion interested herself in one
age, in contending for that pointed form to which Nature conducts it: at
a succeeding period, anathemas have been denounced against those who
refused to give it a rounder shape; and to those, other denunciations
have followed, which changed it to the square or the scollop. But, while
religious caprice<ins class = "correction"
title = "printed as shown: error for dash--?">; </ins>for religion, sorry am I to say it, seems to
be troubled with caprices<span class = "locked">---</span>quarrelled
about form and shape, the disputes were confined within the pale of the
European Church: but, when the beard lessened into whiskers, and the
scythe of ecclesiastical discipline threatened to mow down every hair
from off the face, the East sounded the alarm, and the churches of Asia
and Africa took up the cause, and supported, with all the violence of
argument and remonstrance, those honours of the chin that they still
preserve, and to which the existing inhabitants of those climates offer
up a perpetual incense.</p>

<p>In the history of the Gallic Church, the scenes of religious comedy
still live in description. For example:&mdash;a bearded Bishop appears
at the door of a Cathedral in all the pomp of Prelacy, and demands
installation to the diocese
<span class = "pagenum">180b</span>
to which he is appointed. He is there met by a troop of beardless
Canons, and refused admittance, unless he will employ the golden
scissors they present to him, to cut that flowing ornament from his
face, which they would think a disgrace to their own, as well as to the
religion they profess. This same history, also, is not barren of
examples, where the sturdy prelate has turned indignant from the
disgraceful proposal, and sought the enforcing aid of sovereign power,
which has not always been able, without much difficulty, to compel the
reluctant chapter to acknowledge a bearded Diocesan. Others, unwilling
to risk or delay the power and wealth of an episcopal throne for the
sake of a cumbrous bush of hair, have, by the ready sacrifice of their
beards, been installed amid acclamations and hosannas, as disgraceful as
they were undeserved. It may appear still more ridiculous, but it is no
less true, that some of these bishops have compounded the matter with
their refractory clergy, in giving up the greater part of the beard, but
retaining the growth of the upper lip in the form of whiskers. The idea
of a bishop ‘en moustaches’ must trouble the spirit of a modern
christian; but such there have been, who, in the act of sacrificing to
the God of Peace, have exhibited the fierce terrific aspect of a German
Pioneer.</p>

<p>At length, the persecuted Beard, which has been the object of such
faithful veneration, finds in Europe, if we except part of Turkey, its
only asylum in the Capuchin Cloister; unless we add the casual
protection which is given to it by the fanatical Jew, or mendicant
Hermit.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">I assist</span> him to

you have taken up arms against me? Ungrateful Lovzinski! shall I never
find you but amongst my most bitter enemies? Do you return but on
purpose to sacrifice&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>He then, in the most affecting language, recapitulates the pleasures
of our early youth; our more intimate connection at an age approaching
to manhood, the tender friendship which we had sworn to each other, and
the regard which he had ever treated me with since that period. He spoke
to me of the honours with which he would have loaded me during his
reign, if I had been ambitious to merit them: he reproached me more
particularly respecting the unworthy enterprise of which I appeared to
be the leader, but of which, he said, he was well assured that I was no
more than the instrument.</p>

<p>He threw all the horror of the plot upon Pulaski, representing to me,
at the same time, that the author of such an attempt was not the sole
culpable person; that I could not charge myself with its execution
without committing a crime; and that this odious complaisance, so highly
treasonable in a subject, was infinitely more in a friend. He concluded
by pressing me to restore him to his liberty: “Fly,” said he to me; “and
be assured, if I encounter any of the Russians patroles, I&nbsp;shall
tell them that you have pursued an opposite road from that which you
have taken.”</p>

<p>The king continued to press me with the most earnest entreaties: his
natural eloquence, augmented by the danger of his situation, carried
persuasion to my heart, and awakened the most tender sentiments
there.</p>

<p>I confess that I staggered; I balanced the circumstances for some
time in my own mind, but Pulaski at length triumphed.</p>

<p>I thought that I still heard the fierce republican reproaching me
with my pusillanimity. The love of one’s country has perhaps its
fanaticism and its superstitions: but if I was then culpable, I&nbsp;am
still so; I&nbsp;am more than ever persuaded that in obliging the king
to remount his horse again, I&nbsp;performed an action that reflected
honour on my patriotism.</p>

<p>“Is it thus,” says he to me, in a melancholy accent, “that you reject
the prayer addressed to you by a friend? that you refuse the pardon
offered to you by your king? Well then, let us begone. I&nbsp;deliver
myself up to my unhappy fate, or rather, I&nbsp;abandon you to
yours.”</p>

<p>We now re-commence our journey once more; but
<span class = "pagenum">181b</span>
the entreaties of the monarch, his arguments, his reproaches, his very
menaces, the struggles which I felt within myself, affected me in such a
manner, that I no longer could discern my way. Wandering up and down the
country, I&nbsp;kept no one certain road: after half an hour’s fatigue
we found ourselves at Marimont, and I was greatly alarmed at seeing us
thus return towards Warsaw, instead of leaving it at a distance.</p>

<p>At about a quarter of<ins class = "correction"
title = "word missing"> a </ins>league beyond this, we unfortunately fell in with a
party of Russians. The king immediately discovers himself to the
commanding officer, and then instantly adds. “In the course of the
preceding afternoon, I&nbsp;happened to bewilder myself during the
chace; this good peasant, whom you see here, insisted on my partaking a
frugal repast in his cottage; but as I thought that I perceived some of
the soldiers of Pulaski roaming in the neighbourhood, I&nbsp;was
desirous of returning to Warsaw immediately, and you will oblige me much
by instantly accompanying me thither.</p>

<p>“As to you, my friend,” continues he, turning at the same time
towards me, “I&nbsp;am not at all sorry that you have given yourself
this useless trouble, for I am as much pleased at returning to my
capital attended by these gentlemen (pointing at the same time to the
escort), as in accompanying you any farther. However, it would be
improper that I should leave you without any recompence; what are you
desirous of? Speak&mdash;I will grant you any favour which you may
demand of&nbsp;me!”</p>

<p>It will be easy to conceive hew much I was alarmed, for I was still
doubtful of the king’s intentions. I&nbsp;endeavoured therefore to
discover the true meaning of his equivocal discourse, which must be
either full of a bitter irony, or a magnanimous address. M&nbsp;de P***
left me for some time in this cruel uncertainty: “I&nbsp;behold you
greatly embarrassed,” continues he at length, with a gracious air; “you
know not what to choose! Come then, my friend, embrace me: there is
indeed more honour than profit in embracing a king (adds he with a
smile); however, it must be allowed, that, in my place, many monarchs
would not be at this moment so generous as myself!” On uttering these
words, he instantly departs, leaving me penetrated with gratitude, and
confounded with so much true greatness.</p>

<p>However the danger which the king had so generously relieved me from,
began every moment to assail me again. It was more than probable that a
great number of couriers expedited from Warsaw, had spread about on all
sides the astonishing news of the king’s having been carried off.
Already, without doubt, the ravishers were warmly pursued. My remarkable
dress might betray me in my flight, and if I once more fell into the
hands of any of the Russians, better informed of the circumstance, all
the efforts of the king would not be able to save me. Supposing Pulaski
had obtained all the success which he expected, he must still be at a
great distance; a&nbsp;journey of ten more leagues at least regained for
me to perform, and my horse was entirely spent with fatigue:
I&nbsp;endeavoured however to spur him on, but he had not got five
hundred paces before he fell under&nbsp;me.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page182" id = "page182">182</a></span>
<p>A cavalier, well mounted, happened to pass along the road by the side
of me, at this very moment; he perceived the poor animal tumble down,
and, thinking to amuse himself at the expence of an unfortunate peasant,
he began to banter me about my situation. Piqued at this buffoonery,
I&nbsp;resolved to punish him for his raillery, and secure my own flight
at one and the same time: I, therefore, instantly present one of my
pistols to his breast, and obliged him to surrender his own horse to me;
nay, I&nbsp;acknowledge to you, that, forced by the peculiarity of my
situation, I&nbsp;despoiled him even of his cloak, which being very
large, hid all my rags beneath it, which otherwise might have discovered
me. I&nbsp;then cast my purse full of gold at the feet of the astonished
traveller, and sprang <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘foward’">forward</ins> as fast as my new horse could carry&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, he was fresh and vigorous.---I dart forward twelve
leagues, with all the swiftness of an arrow: at length I think I hear
the firing of cannon, and I instantly conjecture that my father-in law
was at hand, and was employed in fighting the Russians.</p>

<p>I was not deceived---I arrive on the field of battle at the very
moment when one of our regiments had given way. I&nbsp;instantly
discover myself to the fugitives, and having rallied them beneath a
neighbouring hill, I&nbsp;attack the enemies in flank, while Pulaski
charges them in front with the remainder of his troops. Our manœuvres
were so well concerted, and so admirably executed, that the Russians
were entirely routed, after experiencing a terrible carnage.</p>

<p>Pulaski deigned to attribute to me the honour of their defeat: “Ah!”
cries he, embracing me, after hearing the particulars of my
expedition<span class = "locked">---</span>“ah! if your forty followers
had but equalled you in courage, the king would have been at this very

however, that you have been preserved to us; and I return you thanks for
the important service which you have rendered me: but for you, Kaluvski
would have assassinated the monarch, and my name would have been covered
with an eternal opprobrium!</p>

<p>“I might have been able,” added he, “to have advanced two miles
farther; but I rather chose to take possession of this respectable post,
on account of the security of my camp. Yesterday, in the course of my
march, I&nbsp;surprised, and cut in pieces, a&nbsp;party of Russians;
this morning I beat two more of their detachments; but another

took advantage of the night, on purpose to attack me. My <ins class =

troops upon that errand. On the first alarm, nine tenths of the
inhabitants removed to Manheim, leaving behind them about twenty
insignificant people, and a poor shepherd, who, beside being a brave
fellow, was a man of humour. The shepherd in good time fastened the
gates, let down the drawbridge, and made a wonderful shew of resistance.
A&nbsp;trumpeter summoned the village in form, upon which the few
inhabitants that remained made their escape through a postern-gate, and
left only the shepherd, and the shepherdess, big with child. This
unaccountable peasant, in a style of the representative of a garrison,
gave audience, from the walls, to the military herald, and made his
terms of capitulation, inch by inch, stipulating, at the same time, for
the preservation of the state, and the free exercise of the protestant
religion. Imagine, therefore, what must be the surprise of the
Spaniards, when they entered the village, and found him and his wife
only in it! Yet the droll peasant preserved the muscles of his
countenance inflexible; and, some weeks afterward, when his wife lay in,
he desired the great Gonsalvo to be godfather; which honour the pompous
Spaniard, for the jest’s sake, could not decline, but on the contrary,
sent her some very handsome presents. This account, the historian
(<i>Mr.&nbsp;Spanheim, Hist. de l’ Elect. Palet.</i>) says, might appear
a little romantic to posterity, if the notoriety of it had not been a

are of a very romantic kind. Married to a young husband, who soon was
obliged to absent himself from her, to enter on an office he had
obtained in Provence, she ran away with a fencing master, of whom she
learnt the small sword, and became an excellent fencer, which was
afterwards a useful qualification to her on several occasions. The
lovers first retreated from persecution to Marseilles; but necessity
soon obliged them to solicit employment there, at the opera; and, as
both had by nature good voices, they were received without difficulty.
But soon after this she was seized with a passion for a young person of
her own sex, whom she seduced, but the object of her whimsical

affection being pursued by her friends, and taken, was thrown into the
convent at Avignon, where La Maupin soon followed her; and having
presented herself as a novice obtained admission. Some time after, she
set fire to the convent, and availing herself of the confusion she had
occasioned, carried off her favourite. But being pursued and taken, she
was condemned to the flames for contumacy: a&nbsp;sentence, however,
which was not executed, as the young Marseillaise was found and restored
to her friends.</p>

<p>“She then went to Paris, and made her first appearance on the opera
stage in 1695, when she performed the part of Pallas, in Cadmus, with
the greatest success. The applause was so violent, the she was obliged,
in her car, to take off her casque to salute and thank the public, which
redoubled their marks of approbation. From that time her success was
uninterrupted. <ins class = "correction"

friends, supposing La Maupin to be a man, called her out. She might

of a banker, who took it, as common on the continent, without giving the
gentleman a voucher; but lodged it in an iron chest, and gave to the
gentleman the key. When the contract for the purchase was made, he
called on his banker to receive his cash, when the latter peremptorily
denied his having received any such sum, or having any money transaction
whatever with the gentleman.&mdash;&mdash;In this dilemma the injured
party was advised to apply to M. de Sartine, and he accordingly did so,
and told him his story. The minister sent for the banker, and asked him,
if he had not received such a sum? The banker steadily denied it. “Very
well (replied M. de Sartine), then sit down and write a letter which I
shall dictate to you, and you shall continue in the room with me, until
the answer arrives.” Paper was brought, and
<span class = "pagenum">183b</span>
Sartine dictated, and made him write a letter to his wife, to the
following effect:&mdash;“My dear wife, you must immediately send to me
the sum which Mons. &mdash;&mdash; left in my hands, and which was
deposited originally in the iron chest, in the compting-house, but was
removed you know whither. You must send it instantly, or else I shall be
sent to the Bastile. I&nbsp;am already in the hands of justice.” The
banker stared&mdash;&mdash;“Mon Dieu! (says&nbsp;he) must I send this
letter to my wife?”&mdash;&mdash;“You must (says the minister):
I&nbsp;dare say, if you are guilty of the robbery, your wife, who is
remarkable for her ingenuity, was privy to it, and she will obey your
commands: if you are innocent, she cannot comprehend the order which you
send, and will say so in her answer. We will make the experiment, and if
you resist, you shall go immediately to the Bastile.”</p>

<p>The resolution was decisive. The letter was sent, and in less than an
hour the money was brought in the bags in which it was originally
sealed, and restored to the original owner. M. de Sartine discharged the
banker, telling him the matter should be kept a secret, provided he
acted with more faith and honesty for the future.</p>

<i>From <em>CAMILLA</em>, or a Picture of Youth&mdash;just publishing by
the <span class = "smallcaps">Editor</span>, are extracted the following
striking observations on the superiority of mental accomplishments to
personal attractions:&mdash;</i></p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“Indeed</span>,
Sir&mdash;and pray believe me, I do not mean to repine I have not the
beauty of Indiana; I&nbsp;know and have always heard her loveliness is
beyond all comparison. I&nbsp;have no more, therefore, thought of
envying it, than of envying the brightness of the sun. I&nbsp;knew, too,
I&nbsp;bore no competition with my sisters; but I never dreamt of
competition. I&nbsp;knew I was not handsome, but I supposed many people
besides not handsome, and that I should pass with the rest; and I
concluded the world to be full of people who had been sufferers as well
as myself, by disease or accident. These have been occasionally my
passing thoughts; but the subject never seized my mind; I&nbsp;never
reflected upon it at all, till abuse, without provocation, all at once
opened my eyes, and shewed me to myself! Bear with me, then, my father,
in this first dawn of terrible conviction! Many have been
unfortunate<span class = "locked">---</span>but none unfortunate like
me! Many have met with evils<span class = "locked">---</span>but who
with an accumulation like mine!”</p>

<p>Mr. Tyrold, extremely affected, embraced her with the utmost
tenderness: “My dear, deserving, excellent child,” he cried, “what would
I not endure, what sacrifice not make, to soothe this cruel disturbance,
till time and your own understanding can exert their powers?” Then,
while straining her to his breast with the fondest parental
commiseration; the tears, with which his eyes were overflowing, bedewed
her cheeks.</p>

<p>Eugenia felt them, and sinking to the ground, pressed his knees.
“O&nbsp;my father,” she cried, “a&nbsp;tear from your revered eyes
afflicts me more than all else! Let me not draw forth another, lest I
should become not only unhappy, but guilty. Dry them up, my dearest
father; let me kiss them away.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, then, my poor girl, you will struggle against this
ineffectual sorrow! Tell me you will assert that fortitude which only
waits for your exertion; and tell me you will forgive the misjudging
compassion which feared to impress you earlier with pain!”</p>

<p>“I will do all, every thing you desire! my injustice
<span class = "pagenum">185b</span>
is subdued! my complaints shall be hushed! you have conquered me, my
beloved father! Your indulgence, your lenity shall take place of every
hardship, and leave me nothing but filial affection!”</p>

<p>Seizing this grateful moment, he then required of her to relinquish
her melancholy scheme of seclusion from the world: “The shyness and the
fears which gave birth to it,” said he, “will but grow upon you if
listened to; and they are not worthy the courage I would instil into
your bosom<span class = "locked">---</span>the courage, my Eugenia, of
virtue<span class = "locked">---</span>the courage to pass by, as if
unheard, the insolence of the hard-hearted, and ignorance of the vulgar.
Happiness is in your power, though beauty is not; and on that to set too
high a value would be pardonable only in a weak and frivolous mind;
since, whatever is the involuntary admiration with which it meets, every
estimable quality and accomplishment is attainable without it: and
though, which I cannot deny, its immediate influence is universal, yet
in every competition and in every decision of esteem, the superior, the
elegant, the better part of mankind give their suffrages to merit alone.
And you, in particular, will find yourself, through life, rather the
more than the less valued, by every mind capable of justice and
compassion, for misfortunes which no guilt has incurred.”</p>

<p>Observing her now to be softened, though not absolutely consoled, he
rang the bell, and begged the servant, who answered it, to request his
brother would order the coach immediately, as he was obliged to return
home; “And you, my love,” said he, “shall accompany me; it will be the
least exertion you can make in first breaking through your averseness to
quit the house.”</p>

<p>Eugenia would not resist; but her compliance was evidently repugnant
to her inclination; and in going to the glass to put on her hat, she
turned aside from it in shuddering, and hid her face with both her
hands.</p>

<p>“My dearest child,” cried Mr. Tyrold, wrapping her again in his arms,
“this strong susceptibility will soon wear away; but you cannot be too
speedy nor too firm in resisting it. The omission of what never was in
our power cannot cause remorse, and the bewailing what never can become
in our power cannot afford comfort. Imagine but what would have been the
fate of Indiana, had
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page186" id = "page186">186</a></span>
your situations been reversed, and had she, who can never acquire your
capacity, and therefore never attain your knowledge, lost that beauty
which is her all; but which to you, even if retained, could have been
but a secondary gift. How short will be the reign of that all! how
useless in sickness! how unavailing in solitude! how inadequate to long
life! how forgotten, or repiningly remembered in old age! You will live
to feel pity for all you covet and admire; to grow sensible to a lot
more lastingly happy in your own acquirements and powers; and to
exclaim, with contrition and wonder, time was when I would have changed
with the poor mind-dependent Indiana!”</p>

<p>The carriage was now announced; Eugenia, with reluctant steps,
descended; Camilla was called to join them, and Sir Hugh saw them set
off with the utmost delight.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> death-like
paleness of the Duke’s countenance, his perturbated mien, his steps now
slow and now moving with vehemence, and the contortions of his lips,
bespoke the tempest raging in his soul, as exceeding the violence of the
hurricane that was lashing the ocean. The hapless man now looked up to
heaven, and now cast his anxious looks around, as if in search of some
person, and I heard him pronounce repeatedly the name of Hiermanfor.
This sight wounded my heart deeply, and pressed burning tears from my
eyes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a dreadful accident happened on the sea. The anchors which
the fore-part of the ship was moored with were torn from the cables by
the violent agitation of the vessel, which, riding now only with the
small bower, was dashed against the adjacent rocks. A&nbsp;general
piercing cry filled the air when this lamentable incident happened. The
Duke was going to plunge into the sea, and I retained him with great
difficulty by his right arm. Seeing, however, that his despair rendered
him callous against our ardent prayers not to rush into the very jaws of
death, Pietro and myself tied a long rope round his body, taking hold of
one end. He now plunged into the boiling waves, which instantly
devoured, and soon after cast him up again. Thus he advanced daringly
towards the ship. He seemed several times to have a chance of forcing
his way to the vessel, the irregular motions of the sea leaving him on
the dry rocks; however the towering billows then returned with
additional fury, and buried him beneath an enormous mass of water, which
flung the Duke half dead upon the shore. But no sooner had he recovered
his senses, than he darted up, hastening with new courage towards the
vessel, which, however, began to separate, torn by the
<span class = "pagenum">186b</span>
violence of the furious waves. The ship’s crew, who now despaired of
saving their lives, plunged in crowds into the sea, grasping in the
agony of despondency the floating chests, casks, and whatsoever they
could lay hold&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that horrid scene of woe! Two ladies now made
their appearance on the stern of the vessel: one of them was the
Countess and the other Lady Delier. Amelia expanded her arms towards her
lover, who exerted all his strength to join the darling of his
soul.&mdash;She seemed to have known the Duke by his undaunted courage.
The baroness wrung her hands looking anxiously at the spectators, and
pointing at Amelia, as if she wanted to say: leave me to my fate, but
save my friend! Amelia was standing on the deck without betraying the
smallest sign of fear, and seemed to be resigned to her impending
deplorable doom, beckoning to us, as if she wanted to bid us an eternal
adieu. All the spectators wept, and rent the air with doleful cries and
lamentations. The Duke summoned the last remains of his strength,
struggling with the frothing waves, in order to save his mistress from
the brink of fell destruction; but a mountainous billow of an enormous
bulk forced its way through the space betwixt the island and the coast,
darting at the ship. In the same moment Amelia rushed into Lady Delier’s
arms encircling her friend in wild agony, and in that situation they
were buried in the abyss along with the vessel.</p>

<p>The stupefaction of horror which we were seized with, rendered us
almost incapable of dragging the Duke on shore. The spirit of the
hapless man seemed to have fled to better regions, along with that of
his ill-fated bride. He was stretched out on the ground, violently
bleeding, and seemingly a lifeless corpse.</p>

<p>I dropped down by his side, seized with terror and grief, imprinting
kisses on his ash-pale face, contorted by pains, I&nbsp;called his,
mine, and at last Amelia’s name in his ear; but seeing him without the
least motion at the sound of the latter, I&nbsp;really feared that he
was dead. Pietro beat his breast, tore his hair, and rent the air with
doleful lamentations. The bye-standers crowded upon us, and perceiving,
after many fruitless trials, some faint vestiges of life in the Duke, we
carried him to the next house and put him to bed. The contusions and
wounds he had received, by having been dashed against the rocks, were
examined by a surgeon, who declared they were not mortal. I&nbsp;uttered
a loud shout, throwing myself on my knees, and offering fervent thanks
to God. The Duke opened his eyes and closed them again. The surgeon
desired us to retire, and not to disturb his rest.</p>

<p>While Pietro went on horseback to the house of the Marquis, in order
to inform him of the accident that had happened to his son,
I&nbsp;repaired to the strand, in hopes that the bodies of Amelia and
Lady Delier would be driven on shore. However the wind having shifted
suddenly, as is usual in hurricanes, I&nbsp;was obliged to give up the
hope of procuring an honourable burial to those unhappy ladies.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page187" id = "page187">187</a></span>
<p>The Duke was in a senseless stupor, when I returned. Alas! his spirit
seemed to tarry reluctantly in a world which separated him from his
adored Amelia. But why should I tear open again my half-cicatrised
wounds? I&nbsp;shall not enter into a description of his situation,
I&nbsp;still fancy I hear the shrieks of horror, and the wild shouts
which he uttered during a burning fever, when he fancied he saw his
Amelia either in dangerous or in happy situations. His imagination and
his lips were constantly occupied with her. When, at length, his fever
abated, and his recollection returned, he really fancied the history of
Amelia’s hapless fate to be the delusion of a feverish dream. Although I
was very cautious to dislodge this delusive opinion only gradually, yet
the discovery of his error affected him so violently, that I apprehended
it would deprive him, if not of his life, at least of his
understanding.</p>

<p>Here I cannot omit mentioning a scene which happened at the beginning
of his amendment. The Marquis had ordered him to be carried to his house
as soon as he began to mend, and nursed him with paternal care. He came,
one day, when the Duke was sleeping, and I sitting by his bed-side, to
enquire how his son did; as he bent over the sleeper, and seemed to look
anxiously whether any signs of returning health appeared in his face, he
observed on the bosom of his son a blue ribbon. He pulled it carefully
out, and the picture of the Queen of Fr**ce was suspended to it. The
countenance of the Marquis resembled at first that of a person who is
dubious whether he is awake or dreaming; but soon after I saw his face
grow deadly pale, and his whole frame quiver violently. No sooner had he
recovered the power of utterance, then he begged me to retire. Two hours
after he left the apartment in violent agitation, without observing me.
On my entrance into the sick room I found the Duke bathed in tears. The
ribbon was still fastened round his neck, but the picture of the Queen
was taken from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>I signified to him my astonishment. He squeezed my hand tenderly, and
said:&mdash;“You are my only friend, <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged: error for from">for</ins> whom I wish to have no
secrets; and yet I am so unhappy as to have this wish too denied me.
Don’t press me to tell you what has been transacted between me and my
father; I&nbsp;have been obliged to promise with a dreadful oath to take
the secret along with me in my grave&mdash;In my grave!” he added a
little while after, “I&nbsp;am impatient to occupy that habitation ever
since Amelia and <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘Antonia’">Antonio</ins> have made it their abode.”</p>

<p>“Miguel” I exclaimed, straining him to my heart, “dispel these gloomy
thoughts. You shall learn that one has not lost every thing when in
possession of a friend like&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“I know you, and I thank you,” he replied, with emotion, “let us die
together; this world is not deserving to contain us. What business have
we in a
<span class = "pagenum">187b</span>
world (he added with a ghastly look) in which vice only triumphs, and
good men find nothing but a grave?”</p>

<p>Reader, do not fancy this language to have originated merely from a
transient agitation of mind; alas! it originated from a heart
exasperated by the concurrence of the most melancholy misfortunes, and
this exasperation was rooted deeper than I had fancied at first. It
generated in his soul poisonous shoots which injured his religion. He
declared it to be impossible a good God could designedly make good men
so unhappy as he had been rendered. He ascribed the origin of his
misfortunes to a bad principle, which, having a share in the government
of the world, had appropriated his understanding merely to the execution
of its bad purposes. He maintained that it was contrary to the nature of
an infinitely good being to effect even the best purposes by bad means;
and if there were in this world as much disorder, imperfection, and
misfortune, as harmony, perfection and happiness, this would be an
undeniable proof that the world was governed, and had been created
jointly by a good and bad principle. In short, he subscribed entirely to
the system of the <i>Manichees</i>.</p>

<p>I perceived this new deviation of his mind with astonishment and
grief, and thought it my duty to lead him back in the path of truth as
soon as possible, because this error deprived him of the last
consolation in his sufferings. For which reason I endeavoured to
convince him, that the ideas of a bad and a good principle annul each
other; that it is a downright contradiction to believe in the existence
of a bad God: that consequently, the fundamental ideas of his system
were absurd, and, of course, the system itself unsupported.
I&nbsp;proved to him that the evil in this world is not inconsistent
with the goodness and providence of God, and that even the happiness of
the wicked, and the sufferings of the good, ought not to undermine our
belief, but rather to strengthen our hope of a life hereafter, in which
every one will receive the just reward of his actions. But how
convincing soever my arguments would have been to any unprejudiced
person, yet they made very little impression on the Duke, whom the
disharmony and gloominess of his mind had too much prepossessed for his
comfortless system. Far from finding the least contradiction in it, he
was firmly persuaded that the belief in a bad principle served to defend
God against the complaints and reproaches of the unfortunate, while he
found a great consolation in venting his resentment against the bad
principle, whom he believed to be the author of his sufferings. He was
therefore firmly resolved to refute the arguments which I had opposed to
his system; and as soon as he was able to leave his bed, began to
arrange his ideas on that head, and to secure them by a proper train of
arguments against my objections. He had almost finished his work when
Alumbrado returned from his journey.</p>

<p class = "inset smallcaps"><span class = "extended">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Of</span> a situation in
life respectable only because it is honest, I&nbsp;am neither depressed
by a sense of inferiority nor elated with the idea of superior
importance&mdash;Of feelings, not yet blunted by habits of depravity,
I&nbsp;have a smile for beauty, and a tear for distress; and,
I&nbsp;trust, there are some who will bear me witness, that I have a
heart for friendship and for love&mdash;fond of society, and by no means
an enemy to study, my time is usually divided between mankind, my books,
and my thoughts. Of passions strong and lively, pleasure has to me
peculiar charms; and though my charitable dispositions may be often
disobliged, perhaps neither my mental nor corporeal constitution has
cause to complain, that my finances do not co-extend with my desires.
A&nbsp;commencement like this, may probably impress you with no very
favorable idea of the purport of this address; and, suspecting its
contents as no way likely to interest your readers, you may be induced
to throw by this paper as a tax upon your patience: but, if you can
summon fortitude sufficient to continue your perusal, I&nbsp;trust you
will find reason, not only to excuse, but even to approve the egotism of
my preamble.</p>

<p>To introduce their work with some account of the author, has,
I&nbsp;believe, been generally the practice of those who offer to the
public what are called periodical writings. I&nbsp;have conceived a
similar design, and offer this for your acceptance as introductory to a
course of numbers, with which, I&nbsp;hope, through the blessing of
patience and the permission of indolence, from time to time to present
you. Yet, it was not to gratify curiosity alone that I thought fit to
delineate my conduct and my feelings. I&nbsp;believed that, like the
exordium of the orator, it might prepare for my offspring a favorable
reception.</p>

<p>The first and least interesting part of my egotistic narrative is my
situation in life: From this, the only recommendation I can hope to
derive is, that sentiment will at least not be corrupted by the habits
of profession.</p>

<p>Secondly&mdash;To an author of sensibility, surely no objection can
be found; a&nbsp;capacity to enjoy the sweets of friendship and the
raptures of love will be no disadvantage in the eyes of the virtuous and
the fair.</p>

<p>Thirdly&mdash;From commerce with man I may gain some knowledge of his
tempers and propensities; from reading I will imbibe the sentiments of
those much wiser than myself; and by comparing my own deductions with
their abstract conclusions, I&nbsp;may, in converse with myself, give
some degree of clearness, correctness, and solidity to my
conceptions.</p>

<p>To the last feature in my character, which is properly the result of
situation, I&nbsp;believe I may with truth ascribe the greater part of
my literary acquirements, and what is not quite so honourable to myself,
my presumption in becoming an author. To it I shall certainly be
indebted for opportunities to exert the attention necessary for the
execution of my design. And should not my papers afford instruction or
entertainment to others (a&nbsp;persuasion
<span class = "pagenum">188b</span>
of which I am not vain enough to entertain) they will at least procure
improvement to myself. Convinced of the latter, and with a wish to the
former, I&nbsp;offer myself a candidate for an office in your literary
dispensary.</p>

<p>That subjecting one’s-self to the odium of mankind is the infallible
consequence of reprobating his vices and ridiculing his follies, though
often asserted, is by no means the fact. In the moment of calmness,
uninfluenced by passion, man acknowledges and condemns his errors; and
they are not angels alone who <i>weep</i> for the apishness of humanity.
It is in such a state of mind that we usually read; and the author need
not fear for his censures or his laugh<span class =
"locked">---</span>strange that he should, when he has often occasion to
expose those weaknesses in which he participates, and those crimes which
disgrace himself. If, therefore, from reflection on my own conduct or
observation of that of others in those hazardous moments when reason
leaves the helm, I&nbsp;should at any time be induced to choose these
themes, I&nbsp;shall have less reason to fear a frown for my intentions
than contempt for my incompetency. And should I not pay a tribute to
your fancy of one pathetic tale of hapless love, or of the wondrous
adventures of one heroic knight, look not ye fair with disdain upon my
labours. I&nbsp;love your sex, and deem their favour not the least of
those few blessings that raise a wish for life: And, though now a
hopeless thought, if in some happy hour I should conceive imagination
equal to the task, I&nbsp;may attempt to gratify myself by pleasing
you.</p>

<h4><span class = "giant">MAN</span>.</h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">Man</span> is the lord of all the sublunary
creation; the howling savage, the winding serpent, with all the
untameable and rebellious offspring of nature, are destroyed in the
contest, or driven at a distance from his habitations. The extensive and
tempestuous ocean, instead of limiting or dividing his power, only
serves to assist his industry, and enlarge the sphere of his enjoyments.
Its billows, and its monsters, instead of presenting a scene of terror,
only call up the courage of this little intrepid being; and the greatest
danger that man now fears on the deep, is from his fellow-creatures.
Indeed, when I consider the human race as Nature has formed them, there
is but very little of the habitable globe that seems made for them. But
when I consider them as accumulating the experience of ages, in
commanding the earth, there is nothing so great, or so terrible. What a
poor contemptible being is the naked savage, standing on the beach of
the ocean, and trembling at its tumults! How little capable is he of
converting its terrors into benefits; or of saying, behold an element
made wholly for my enjoyment! He considers it as an angry Deity, and
pays it the homage of submission. But it is very different when he has
exercised his mental powers; when he has learned to find his own
superiority, and to make it subservient to his commands. It is then that
his dignity begins to appear, and that the true Deity is justly praised
for having been mindful of man; for having given him the earth for his
habitation, and the sea for an inheritance.</p>

(<i>Continued from <a href = "#page182">page 182</a>.</i>)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">In</span> the mean time,
the camp resounded with the cries of gladness, and our victorious
soldiers mingled my praises with those of Pulaski. At the noise of my
name, repeated by a thousand tongues, Lodoiska ran to her father’s tent.
She convinced me of the excess of her tenderness, by the excess of her
joy at our meeting; and I was obliged once more to commence the recital
of the dangers from which I had escaped. She could not hear of the
singular generosity of the monarch, when I was in the power of the
Russians, without shedding tears: “How magnanimous he is!” exclaims she,
amidst a transport of joy; “how worthy of being a king, he who so
generously pardoned you! How many sighs has he spared a wife whom you
forsake! how many tears the loving wife whom you are not afraid of
sacrificing! Cruel Lovzinski, are not the dangers to which you daily
expose yourself sufficient&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Pulaski here interrupts his daughter with a certain degree of
harshness: “Indiscreet and weak woman!” exclaims he, “is it before me
that you dare to hold such a discourse as this?”</p>

<p>“Alas!” replies she in a mild accent; “alas! must I forever tremble
for the life of a father and a husband?” Lodoiska also made the most
affecting complaints to me, and sighed after a more happy futurity,
while fortune was preparing for us the most cruel reverse.</p>

<p>Our Cossacks, placed at the out-posts, now came in from all parts,
and informed us that the Russian army was approaching. Pulaski reckoned
on being attacked at the break of day; but he was not: however, about
the middle of the following night I was informed that the enemy was
preparing to force our entrenchments.</p>

<p>Pulaski, always ready, always active, was actually defending them:
during the course of this fatal night, he achieved every thing that
might have been expected from his valour and experience.</p>

<p>We repel the assailants no less than five different times, but they
return unceasingly to the charge, pour in fresh troops at every new
attack, and, during the last one, penetrate into the heart of our very
camp by three different avenues, at one and the same time.</p>

<p>Zaremba was killed by my side; a crowd of nobles fell in this bloody
action; the enemy refused to give any quarter. Furious at seeing all my
friends perish before my eyes, I&nbsp;resolved to precipitate myself
into the midst of the Russian battalions.</p>

<p>“Heedless man!” exclaims Pulaski, “what blind fury urges you towards
your destruction? My army is entirely routed<span class =
"locked">---</span>destroyed<span class = "locked">---</span>but my
courage still remains! Why should we perish uselessly here? Let us be
gone! I&nbsp;will conduct you into climes where we may raise up new
enemies
<span class = "pagenum">189b</span>
against the Russian name. Let us live, since we can still serve our
country! Let us save ourselves, let us save Lodoiska.”</p>

<p>“Lodoiska! am I capable of abandoning her?”</p>

<p>We instantly run to her tent&mdash;we are scarce in time: we carry
her off, precipitate ourselves into the neighbouring woods, and on the
next morning we venture to sally forth, and present ourselves before the
gate of a castle that was not altogether unknown to&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>It indeed belonged to a noble Pole, who had served during some time
in our army. Micislas instantly comes forth, and offers an asylum, which
he advises us, however, to make use of for a few hours only. He informs
us, that a very astonishing piece of news had spread abroad on the
former evening, and began to be confirmed, according to which the king
himself had been carried away out of Warsaw, that the Russians had
pursued the conspirators, and brought back the monarch to his capital;
and that, in fine, it was talked of putting a price upon the head of
Pulaski, who was suspected of being the author of this treason.</p>

<p>“Believe me,” says he, “when I assure you, whether you have engaged
or not in this bold plot, that you ought to fly; leave your uniforms
here, which will assuredly betray you: I&nbsp;will instantly supply you
with clothes which are less remarkable: and as to Lodoiska,
I&nbsp;myself will conduct her to the place which you have chosen for
your retreat.”</p>

<p>Lodoiska now interrupts Micislas: “The place of my retreat shall be
that of their flight, for I will accompany them every where.”</p>

<p>Pulaski represents to his daughter, that she was not able to sustain
the fatigue incident to such a long journey, and that besides we should
be liable to continual dangers.</p>

<p>“The greater the peril is,” replies she, “the more I ought to partake
it with you. You have repeated to me a hundred times, that the daughter
of Pulaski ought not to be an ordinary woman. For the last eight years I
have constantly lived in the midst of alarms; I&nbsp;have seen nothing
but scenes of carnage and horror. Death has environed me on all sides,
and menaced me at every moment: will you not permit me to brave it now
by your side? Is not the life of Lodoiska connected with that of her
father? Lovzinski, will not the stroke that fells you to the ground send
your wife to the grave? and am I no longer worthy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I now interrupt Lodoiska, and join with her father, in stating the
reasons which determined us to leave her in Poland. She hears me with
impatience: “Ungrateful man,” exclaims she at length, “will you fly
without me?” “You shall remain,” replies Pulaski, “with Lovzinski’s
sisters, and I prohibit you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His daughter, now frantic with grief, would not permit him to finish
the sentence.</p>

<p>“I know your rights, my father! I respect them; they shall always
appear sacred to me: but you do not possess that of separating a wife
from her husband<ins class = "correction"

<p>“My father! Lovzinski! hear me, both of you; I am determined to
accompany you every where!</p>

<p>“Yes, I will follow you every where, cruel men! I will follow you in
spite of yourselves!</p>

<p>“Lovzinski, if your wife has lost all the rights she had over your
heart, recollect at least her who was once the mistress of your
affections.</p>

<p>“Recal to your remembrance that frightful night, when I was about to
perish in the flames; that terrible moment when you ascended the burning
tower, crying out, let me live or die with Lodoiska!</p>

<p>“That which you felt at that terrible moment, I now experience!
I&nbsp;know no greater evil than that of being separated from you; and I
now exclaim in my turn, let me either live or die with my father and my
husband!</p>

<p>“Unfortunate wretch! what will become of me, if you should forsake
me. Reduced to the cruel situation of bewailing you both, where shall I
find a solace for my miseries? Will my children console me? Alas! in two
years death hath snatched four away from me; and the Russians, equally
pitiless as death itself, have bereaved me of the last! I&nbsp;have only
you remaining in the world, and even you wish to abandon me! my father!
my husband! Will such dear connexions as these be insensible to my
sufferings! Have compassion, take pity on your own Lodoiska.”</p>

<p class = "word3">. . . . . . . . .<br>
. . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>Her tears now intercepted her speech. Micislas wept; my heart was
torn with anguish. “You are resolved to accompany us, my daughter<span
class = "locked">---</span>be it so; I&nbsp;consent,” says Pulaski, “but
I wish that heaven may not punish me for my complaisance!”</p>

<p>Lodoiska now embraces us both with as much joy at if all our ills had
been at an end. I&nbsp;leave two letters with Micislas, which he
undertook to transmit according to the direction: the one was addressed
to my sisters, and the other to Boleslas. I&nbsp;bade them adieu, and I
recommended to them, to neglect no means to endeavour to recover my dear
Dorliska!</p>

<p>It was necessary that I should disguise my wife---she assumes a
masculine dress; we change our own, and we employ all the means in our
power to disfigure ourselves in such a manner as to elude research, and
prevent discovery.</p>

<p>Thus altered in our appearance, armed with our sabres and our
pistols, provided with a considerable sum in gold, with some trinkets,
and all the jewels of Lodoiska, we take leave of Micislas, and make
haste to regain the woods.</p>

<h4><span class = "super">PLEASURE</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> enthusiasm of
pleasure charms only by intervals. The highest rapture lasts only for a
moment, and all the senses seem so combined, as to be soon tired into
languor by the gratification of any one of them. It is only among the
Poets we hear of men changing to one delight, when satiated with
another. In nature, it is very different; the glutton, when sated with
the full meal, is unqualified to feel the real pleasure of drinking; the
drunkard, in turn, finds few of those transports which lovers boast in
enjoyment; and the lover, when cloyed, finds a diminution of every other
appetite. Thus, after a full indulgence of any one sense, the man of
pleasure finds a languor in all, is placed in a chasm between past and
expected enjoyment, perceives an interval which must be filled up. The
present can give no satisfaction, because he has already robbed it of
every charm. A&nbsp;mind thus left without immediate employment,
naturally recurs to the past or the future: the reflector finds that he
was happy, and knows that he cannot be so now; he sees that he may yet
be happy, and wishes the hour was come: thus every period of his
continuance is miserable, except that very short one of immediate
gratification. Instead of a life of dissipation, none has more frequent
conversations with disagreeable <i>self</i> than he: his enthusiasms are
but few and transient; his appetites, like angry creditors, continually
making fruitless demands for what he is unable to pay; and the greater
his former pleasure, the more strong his regret, the more impatient his
expectations. A&nbsp;life of pleasure is, therefore, the most unpleasing
life in the world.</p>

<p>Habit has rendered the man of business more cool in his desires; he
finds less regret for past pleasures, and less solicitude for those to
come. The life he now leads, though tainted in some measure with hope,
is yet not afflicted so strongly with regret, and is less divided
between shortlived rapture and lasting anguish. The pleasures he has
enjoyed are not so vivid, and those he has to expect cannot consequently
create so much anxiety.</p>

<p>The philosopher, who extends his regard to all mankind, must have
still a smaller concern for what has already affected, or may hereafter
affect himself; the concerns of others make his whole study, and that
study is his pleasure; and this pleasure is permanent in its nature,
because it can be changed at will, leaving but few of those anxious
intervals which are employed in remembrance or anticipation. The
philosopher, by these means, leads a life of almost continued
dissipation; and reflection, which makes the uneasiness and misery of
others, serves as a companion and instructor to him.</p>

<p class = "center smaller">
[From an English Paper.]</p>

<hr class = "w075">

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">The</span> various passions
which agitated my distracted soul have subsided and I now am calm.
I&nbsp;am alone, and in no danger of interruption: the insignificants
that fluttered around me are fled; and their departure gives me no
uneasiness.</p>

<p>I am at leisure to consider what I have been, and what I am; admired,
applauded, courted; avoided, despised, pitied. However, when I take a
view of my own heart, the prospect is less gloomy. I&nbsp;have been
incautious, but not abandoned; indiscreet, but not vicious; faulty, but
not depraved. If female virtue consists, as I have sometimes been told,
in female reputation, my virtue is gone: but if, as my soberer reason
teaches, virtue is independent of human opinion, I&nbsp;feel myself its
ardent votary, and my heart is pregnant with its noblest principles. The
children of ignorance cannot, and the children of malevolence will not,
comprehend this; but I court not their approbation, nor fear their
censure.</p>

<p>My soul, it must be owned, was formed of sensibility, formed for all
the luxury of the melting passions; but it is equally true, that the
severest delicacy had ever a place there. The groves of Br&mdash;<span
class = "locked">---</span>n can witness, that whenever the loves
presided at the entertainment, the graces were not absent: that in the
very delirium of pleasure, the rapture was chastened, and the transport
restrained.</p>

<p>My understanding was never made the dupe to my fonder wishes; nor did
I ever call in the wretched aids of a sceptical and impious philosophy
to countenance my unhappy fall. Though nature was my goddess and my
law-giver, I&nbsp;never dreamt of appealing from the decisions of
positive institutions. My principles were uncorrupted, whilst my heart
was warm; and if I fell as a woman, you know at the same time that I
fell, like Caesar, with decent dignity.</p>

<p>I write not to justify myself to you; you deserve not, you desire not
any such justification; but whilst I open
<span class = "pagenum">193b</span>
my heart, I&nbsp;beg of you to examine your own. The hour of reflection
seldom comes too soon; and what must your sensations be, when you
recollect that you have violated all laws divine and human, broken
through every principle of virtue, and every tie of humanity; that you
have offered an insult to the kind genius of hospitality, the benevolent
spirit of good neighbourhood, and the sacred and dignified powers of
friendship! I&nbsp;mean not to reproach you, but suffer me to ask, was
it not sufficient that you had added my name to the list of your
infamous triumphs (for infamous they are, in spite of sophistry, gaiety,
and the world), that you had ranked me among the daughters of
wretchedness and ignominy, deprived me of my father, my all of comfort,
and my all of hope; were not these things, I&nbsp;say, sufficient,
without adding to them the meanness and baseness of publicly speaking of
me, in language that a gentleman would not have used to the vilest
wanton? weak, unhappy man, I&nbsp;am now indeed ashamed of my
defeat!</p>

<p>For myself, I am well aware that “the world is not my friend, nor the
world’s law.” I&nbsp;expect not nor desire its favour: it never forgives
offences of this kind. My own sex, in particular, is inexorable; for
never did female kindness shed a tear of genuine commiseration upon
misfortunes like mine. The insolent familiarity of some, and the
cautious reserve of others, the affected concern, the self-approving
condolence, sufficiently teach me what is the friendship of women. But I
have no anxiety on this account: the remainder of my days I give to
solitude: and if Heaven will hear my most ardent prayer, if my presaging
heart and declining strength deceive me not, this remainder will not be
long. Sister angels shall joyfully receive me into their happy choirs,
though my too virtuous sisters in this world avoid my company as
contagious. In the mean time, never shall the returning sun gild the
roof of my humble habitation, but I will drop a tear of deep repentance
to the fatal indiscretion which robbed me of my peace, and plunged a
whole family in misery: and, when the hour of my delivery comes, if an
offended parent will but take me in his arms, and pronounce me forgiven,
my heart shall again be sensible of comfort, joy shall once more sparkle
in the eyes&nbsp;of</p>

<p class = "center smaller">
UNFOLDING MANY CURIOUS UNKNOWN HISTORICAL FACTS.</p>

<p class = "center larger">
<i>Translated from the German of Tschink.</i></p>

<p class = "center smaller">
(Continued from <a href = "#page187">page 187</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">It</span> is almost
incredible, with how much appearance of truth and cordiality he
manifested his grief at the hapless fate of the Duke. He affected such a
tender fellow-feeling, and so much friendship for Miguel, that the
latter was charmed with him, and fancied the favourable opinion he had
conceived of Alumbrado to be fully justified. The hypocrite not only
pitied him, but at the same time, endeavoured to afford him comfort.
Mentioning, however, among other arguments, how wonderful the ways of
Providence are, and how God promoted our happiness, even through the
evils of this world; the Duke shook his head. Alumbrado was surprised at
it, and enquired what objection he had against that doctrine? The Duke,
who thought him deserving of his confidence, was so imprudent as to
unfold to him his new creed; nay, he carried his inconsideration so far
as to read to him part of his tract which he had wrote on that subject.
Although I was very much terrified at it, yet I was impatient to know
Alumbrado’s opinion and behaviour on this occasion. My astonishment rose
to the highest degree, when he refuted the arguments of the Duke with a
frankness which generally is supposed to arise only from love of truth,
and defended the goodness and providence of God, with an evidence and
warmth which can originate only from the light of religion. The dignity
and energy with which he spoke had an irresistable effect on the Duke;
he cast his eyes upon the ground in dumb amazement, and appeared to be
confounded and ashamed.</p>

<p>I cannot but confess that I myself began to believe I had been
egregiously mistaken in my opinion of Alumbrado’s character.
I&nbsp;begged his pardon in my heart, and though I could not love him,
yet I thought it my duty not to refuse him my regard any longer.</p>

<p>However, soon after two accidents happened which gave me reason to
apprehend that I had changed my opinion too prematurely. I&nbsp;got
intelligence that Alumbrado visited the house of a man whose character
was very much suspected. Baeza was his name. The important office which
he kept at the custom-house, and the extensive trade he carried on all
over Europe, had rendered his house respected, wealthy, powerful, and
honoured. He was a Jew by birth, but changed his religion from political
motives. His conduct, at least, did not refute the opinion that he
confessed only with his lips the Roman Catholic religion, and it had
given rise to much scandal when Oliva*ez conferred on him the order of
Christ. The connection between him and this minister was very intimate
and not at all shaken by the revolution; but continued, only with more
assiduity and circumspection, which was no difficult task to a
consummate hypocrite like Baeza. It will be obvious that Alumbrado’s
connection with this man displeased me for more than one reason. Another
<span class = "pagenum">194b</span>
circumstance contributed to strengthen my suspicion of Alumbrado’s
honesty. The Duke missed a sheet of his tract on the system of the
<i>Manichees</i>. Alumbrado had visited him frequently, had been alone
in his study many a time where the manuscript was lying on the writing
desk. The Duke, far from suspecting him, fancied he had mislaid the
paper, and having renounced that system on Alumbrado’s persuasion, did
not care much for that tract.</p>

<p>Although my repeated exhortations and my avowed antipathy had not
been able to prevail on my friend to drop all connections with that
dangerous man, yet they had retained him from being too intimate with
him; however, since he knew that I had conceived a more favourable
opinion of Alumbrado, he attached himself more closely to him. The old
Marquis observed this change with great satisfaction, but, at the same
time, saw with greater grief the recovery of his son’s health make but
very slow progress. The cause of it was a secret, but rooted melancholy,
into which the overflowing exasperation of his heart and furious agony
of mind had changed ever since he had adopted the principles of the
Manichean system. This melancholy corroded his vitals like the slow
poison of a cancer, and stopped not only the circulation of the vital
powers, but also the energy of the soul of my unhappy friend in its
wonted activity. The situation of his mind was therefore merely passive,
which rendered him the more susceptible for those external impressions
which fitted the situation of his mind, the less power of resistance and
self-activity he possessed. Thus he was an instrument which Alumbrado
could play on at pleasure. The latter seemed, however, not yet
determined what measures he should take for attaining his aim; but,
unfortunately, the Duke himself put him afterwards on the right track.
He found particular pleasure in conversing with his new confidant on the
happiness which loving souls would derive from their reunion in a better
world, and he neglected me now for no other reason but because I could
say but very little on that subject, while Alumbrado’s imagination and
eloquence were inexhaustible. I&nbsp;had no hope of giving the mind of
the Duke a different turn; his natural vivacity, which formerly so
frequently avocated his attention from one object, and oftentimes
directed it irresistably to another of a nature entirely opposite, this
vivacity was entirely extinguished; a&nbsp;gloomy sameness, which was
immoveably fixed to the object which once had attracted his attention,
having stept in its place. Every terrestrial joy had fled with Amelia,
Lady Delier and Antonio; the source from which he at present derived his
pleasure, originated beyond the grave. How joyfully would he have
overleaped the cleft which separated him from the darlings of his heart,
if he had not been kept back by mine and Alumbrado’s persuasions. This
state of mind encreased his anxious desire of discovering an artificial
bridge of communication with the kingdom of spirits. In short, all the
ideas he had imbibed in the school of the Irishman awoke in his mind
with redoubled force. What at first had been to him a mere object of
knowledge, became now the most important concern of his heart. One time
he surprised Alumbrado with the question whether he thought
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page195" id = "page195">195</a></span>
it possible to converse with spirits before our death? However the
artful man extricated his neck with great dexterity from the sling,
replying, that such a question could not be answered in general, nor
with a few words. I&nbsp;perceived that Alumbrado viewed the Duke
attentively and began to muse, although he had cut off abruptly the
thread of the conversation.</p>

<p>No one can conceive how ardently the Duke longed for the arrival of
the Irishman, of whom he expected to receive the final solution of that
problem. One rather should think that the Irishman ought to have lost
all credit with him, on account of his treacherous behaviour; for not
only his first promise to put the Duke in possession of Amelia by means
of his supernatural power; but also the second, that he would initiate
him in the practical mysteries of his supernatural wisdom, as soon as
the revolution should have been accomplished, was still incompleted.
However, the Duke excused him, instead of suspecting his having deceived
him. “<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘Heirmanfor’">Hiermanfor</ins>,” he said, “is not all powerful; how
could he therefore, avert that fatal blow from Amelia’s head? Hiermanfor
has not fixed the day of his return; perhaps he has been detained by
business of the greatest consequence, or means to try the measure of my
confidence in him; but whatever may be the reason of his non-arrival, he
certainly will not omit to make good his word.” Alumbrado asked him who
that Hiermanfor was? and the Duke related to him at large his adventures
with that man, without betraying the share he had had in the revolution.
I&nbsp;expected that Alumbrado, who at once was made acquainted with so
dangerous a rival, would do his utmost to ruin his credit; but I was
mistaken; all that he ventured to say, was, indeed, very much against
him; but he added, that one ought not to judge prematurely on so great
and deep a character.</p>

<p>This lenient judgment was not sufficient to cure the Duke of his
delusion; although his confidence in the Irishman was very strong, yet
his patience was very weak, and my reasoning against Hiermanfor began to
make him uneasy. Several times was he going to make public inquiries
after him, but the apprehension of offending him without being able to
find him out always prevented him from doing it. At last, when the
Irishman did not appear after a long and fruitless expectation, my
friend took it in his head to inquire after the Count de Clairval and in
case he should discover him, to seize him either by force or art,
because he expected to receive from him some information of Hiermanfor.
Alumbrado desired the Duke to give him a description of the Count. “He
is almost of my size,” my friend replied, “but fair, of an interesting
countenance, and a tranquil, gentle seriousness, generally characterizes
his mien, which however, frequently bespeaks the most jovial humour; his
nose is rather of the aquiline kind, his mouth almost <ins class =
"correction" title = "two words">woman like</ins> handsome, and his chin
falls a little back, yet without disfiguring him.” “If you wish to get
him in your power,” Alumbrado replied, “I&nbsp;will endeavour to
<i>spell-bind him</i>; but then I shall want his picture; could
<span class = "pagenum">195b</span>
you delineate it on a piece of paper?” The Duke, who as little as myself
knew what to think of this offer, looked alternately at me and at
Alumbrado. “Indeed,” the latter continued, “I&nbsp;wish to possess the
picture of the Count; leave the consequence to&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“If you really wish to possess it,” my friend replied. “you shall
have&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>Possessing a great skill in drawing striking likenesses, he finished
the portrait the day following, assisted by his imagination, and gave it
to Alumbrado. We were impatient to learn what he was going to do with
it; however, he visited the Duke four days without mentioning the
picture; but on the fifth day informed him in what hotel he would find
the Count. We were looking at him in dumb astonishment, when he added,
“Make haste, now you can surprise him and if he should refuse to follow
you, you only need to tell him that the guard is waiting for your order
to seize him.”</p>

<h4><i><em>ABSTRACT</em> of the <em>ABBE BERTHOLON’s PAPER</em><br>
on <em>FIRES</em>, and the <em>MEANS</em> of extinguishing
them.</i></h4>

<p class = "center smallest extended">PUBLISHED IN THE LAUSANNE
MEMOIRS.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">This</span> subject is
important and interesting, although the Abbé has rather collected the
observations and experiments made by others, than conveyed any new and
original information. He ascribes the inflammability of bodies to the
inflammable gas which they contain, and which, on their decomposition by
heat, is let loose, and coming into contact with the atmosphere is
ignited, and bursts out into flame. The principal part of the memoir is
devoted to a detail of the means of preventing and extinguishing fires;
and here the author’s chief advice, which is “in the construction of
buildings, to employ as little as possible of those materials which
yield inflammable air on their decomposition,” will be allowed to be
perfectly just in theory, but will probably be little followed in
practice: nor is the security resulting from brick floors likely to
compensate, in this age of affected elegance, for their appearance. He
informs us, however, that M.&nbsp;Ango, an architect of Paris, has
contrived a method of constructing a floor with iron bars, instead of
timber joists, which is even less expensive than the common mode. The
wood used in buildings may be rendered uninflammable, by being steeped
in a saline solution, and by being prepared with allum, even canvass and
paper hangings may be made to burn without flame.</p>

<p>Many other precautions are mentioned by the Abbé, which we shall not
detail, as they are universally known, and we believe pretty generally
adopted. After describing the inventions of Mr. Hartly and Lord Mahon,
together with a preparation similar to that of Lord Mahon’s recommended
by M.&nbsp;Frederic, of Vienna, the Abbé gives an account of a
substance, which he calls paper stone, invented by Dr. Faye, physician
to the Swedish admiralty: its composition is not known, but from a
chemical analysis it appears to consist of two parts of an earthly
basis, and one of animal oil, mixed up with two parts of some vegetable
substance. At Carlscrone a hut was built of dry wood, covered with this
paper, which is not more than two lines in thickness, it was then filled
with combustibles, which were set on fire and consumed without burning
the building: the paper, which had been pasted on boards, was reduced to
a cinder, and formed a kind of incrustation, which preserved them from
the effects of the flame. As this paper readily takes any colour, it may
be rendered ornamental as well as useful.</p>

<p>In his directions for extinguishing fires, the Abbé observes, that
water, in which a small quantity of potash has been dissolved, is more
efficacious than any other; he also recommends an engine called an
hydraulic ventilator, invented by M. Castelli, which is worked by vanes
instead of pistions, and may be managed by one person. The advantages
ascribed by our author to this machine are very considerable, but we
cannot suppress our astonishment on being told, that with a cylinder of
only three inches in diameter, it will throw up more water than the
largest fire engine; however, it certainly appears to be less
<span class = "pagenum">196b</span>
expensive and more portable than the common forcing pumps, and may be of
use in extinguishing a fire, before it has made any great progress. The
utility of garden mould with wet sand in this respect, is well known,
but it can seldom be applied, and we doubt the efficacy of the kind of
catapult which the author recommends, for throwing it so any
distance.</p>

<p>The remainder of the memoir contains some very just and obvious
remarks on the necessity of a regular discipline among firemen, and it
concludes with a description of the engines, cisterns and pipes at the
opera house in Paris, the construction and arrangement of which the Abbé
recommends to be adopted in every public theatre.</p>

Shakespeare, and Milton, were sophistical scribblers, and bad luck to

(Continued from <a href = "#page190">page 190</a>.)</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Pulaski</span> now
communicates to us the design which he had formed of taking refuge in
Turkey. He hoped to be employed in a situation equal to his rank and his
abilities, in the armies of the grand signior, who had for the two last
years with some difficulty sustained a disastrous war against the
Russians.</p>

<p>Lodoiska did not appear in the least affrighted at the long journey
which we had to make; and as she could neither be known nor sought
after, she insisted upon going out to reconnoitre the adjacent country,
and at the same time charged herself with the fatiguing but important
task of bringing us the provisions which we stood in need&nbsp;of.</p>

<p>As soon as the day appeared, we retired into the wood: hid either in
the trunks of trees, or in the thick groves of pines, we waited
impatiently for the return of night, on purpose to continue our march.
It was thus that, during several weeks, we were enabled to escape from
the search of a multitude of different bodies of Russian troops, who
were sent out on purpose to discover us, and who pursued us like so many
blood-hounds, animated with the passions of hatred and revenge.</p>

<p>One day as Lodoiska, still disguised as a peasant, returned from a
neighbouring hamlet, where she had gone on purpose to purchase the
provisions which she was now conveying to us, two Russian marauders
attached her at the entry of the forest in which we were concealed.</p>

<p>After having robbed, they prepared to strip her. At the shrieks which
she uttered we hasten from our retreat, and the two ruffians immediately
betake themselves to flight upon our appearance; but we were greatly
alarmed lest they should recount this adventure to their companions,
whose suspicions aroused by this singular rencounter, might induce them
to come and drag us from our asylum.</p>

<p>After a most fatiguing journey, we enter Polesia<a class = "plain"
name = "tag197a" id = "tag197a" href = "#note197a">*</a>. Pulaski wept
at leaving his native country.</p>

<p>“At least,” exclaims he with a mournful accent---“at least I have
faithfully served you, and I now only go into exile that I may be
enabled to serve you again.”</p>

<p>So many fatigues had exhausted the strength of Lodoiska. Arrived at
Novogorod<a class = "tag" name = "tag197b" id = "tag197b" href =
"#note197b">†</a>, we resolve to stop there on purpose to give her time
to recover her strength. It was our design to remain some days, but some
of the country people whom we questioned, frankly informed us,
<span class = "pagenum">197b</span>
that a number of troops were in motion in that neighbourhood, on purpose
to arrest a certain person of the name of Pulaski, who had occasioned
the king of Poland to be taken prisoner, and carried off from the midst
of his own capital.</p>

<p>Justly alarmed at this intelligence, we remain but a few hours in
this town, where we, however, found means to purchase some horses
without being discovered.</p>

<p>We then pass the Desna above Czernicove<a class = "tag" name =
"tag197c" id = "tag197c" href = "#note197c">‡</a>; and following the
banks of the Sula, we cross that river at Perevoloczna, where we learn
that Pulaski, who had been traced to Novogorod, had escaped as it were
by miracle, and that the Russian soldiers, indefatigable in their
pursuit, were still searching after him, and were in hopes of making him
prisoner.</p>

<p>It was now again become necessary to fly once more, and once more to
change our route; we therefore instantly made for the immense forests
which cover the face of the country between the Sula and the Zem, in the
dark retreats of which we hoped to find shelter from our foes.</p>

<p>We at length discover a cavern, in which we were reduced to the
necessity of taking up our abode. A&nbsp;she-bear disputes with us the
entrance into this asylum equally solitary and frightful: we assail, we
kill her, and devour her young.</p>

<p>Pulaski was wounded in this encounter: Lodoiska, worn out with
fatigue and distress, was scarcely able to support her existence: the
winter was approaching, and the cold was already excessive.</p>

<p>Pursued by the Russians in the inhabited parts; menaced by wild and
ferocious animals in this vast desart; destitute of any arms but our
swords; reduced in a short time to eat our very horses; what was to
become of&nbsp;us?</p>

<p>The danger of the situation to which my father-in-law and my wife
were reduced, had become so pressing, that no other fear any longer
alarmed me. My personal safety, hitherto so dear to me, did not now
suggest itself once to my mind: I&nbsp;felt only for theirs.
I&nbsp;resolved, therefore, to procure to them at any rate those
succours which their situation required, which was still more deplorable
than my own; and leaving them both with the promise of rejoining them in
a short time, I&nbsp;take a few of the diamonds belonging to Lodoiska,
and follow the stream of the Warsklo.</p>

<p>It is well known that a traveller, bewildered amidst those vast
countries, and reduced to the necessity of wandering about without a
compass, and without a guide, is obliged to follow the course of a
river, because it is upon its banks that the habitations of mankind are
most commonly to be met with.</p>

<p>It was necessary that I should gain, as soon at possible, some
considerable town in which a few merchants resided: I&nbsp;therefore
journeyed along the banks of the Warsklo, and travelling day and night,
found myself at Pultava<a class = "tag" name = "tag197d" id = "tag197d"
href = "#note197d">§</a>
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page198" id = "page198">198</a></span>
at the end of four days. During my residence in this place, I&nbsp;pass
for a trader belonging to Bielgorod. I&nbsp;there learn that the Russian
troops were still roaming about in pursuit of Pulaski, and that the
Empress had sent <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘and’">an</ins> exact description of his person every where, with orders
to seize him either dead or alive, wherever he might be found.</p>

<p>I make haste to sell my diamonds, to purchase powder, arms, and
provisions of all kinds, different utensils, and some coarse and
necessary furniture; every thing, in fine, which I judged most proper to
relieve our misery, and soften our misfortunes.<span class =
"locked">---</span>With these I load a waggon, drawn by four good
horses, of which I was the only conductor.</p>

<p>My return was equally tedious and difficult; no less than eight whole
days expired before I arrived at the entrance of the forest.</p>

<p>It was there that, terminating my disagreeable and dangerous journey,
I&nbsp;was about to succour my father-in-law and my wife; that I was
about to revisit all that was most dear to me in the world; and yet I
felt none of those transports of joy which such an event seemed likely
to inspire.</p>

<p>Philosophers have no belief in forebodings.</p>

<p>Certain it is, however, that I experienced an involuntary uneasiness:
my mind became dispirited, dismayed, and something, I&nbsp;know not
what, seemed to whisper to me, that the most unhappy moment of my whole
life was fast approaching.</p>

<p>On my departure, I had placed several flint-stones at certain
distances, on purpose to enable me to retrace my road; but I could not
now discover them. I&nbsp;had also cut off with my sabre large pieces of
the bark of several trees, which I could not now perceive. I&nbsp;enter
the forest, however: I&nbsp;hollow with all my strength:
I&nbsp;discharge my gun from time to time, but nobody answers me.
I&nbsp;dared not trust myself among the trees and shrubs for fear of
losing my way back again; neither could I wander too far from my waggon,
which was stored with provisions so necessary to Pulaski, his daughter,
and myself.</p>

<p>The night, which now approached, obliged me to give over my search,
and I pass it in the same manner as the former. Rolled up in my cloak,
I&nbsp;lay down beneath my waggon, which I had carefully surrounded with
my larger moveables, and which thus served me as a rampart against the
wild beasts.</p>

<p>I could not sleep; the cold was extremely intense; the snow fell in
great abundance; at break of day I looked around, and found all the
ground covered with it. From that moment I formed the most horrible and
the most sinister presages: the stones which might have pointed out the
path I was to have taken, were all buried, and it appeared impossible I
should ever be able to discover my father-in-law and my wife.</p>

<h4><span class = "super">FRIENDSHIP</span>.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">There</span> are few
subjects which have been more written upon, and less understood, than
that of Friendship. To follow the dictates of some, this virtue, instead
of being the assuager of pain, becomes the source of every
inconvenience. Such speculatists, by expecting too much from friendship,
dissolve the connexion; and, by drawing the bands too closely, at length
break them. Almost all our romance and novel-writers are of this kind;
they persuade us to friendships, which we find impossible to sustain to
the last; so that this sweetener of life, under proper regulations, is,
by their means, rendered inaccessible or uneasy.</p>

<p>Friendship is like a debt of honour: the moment it is talked of, it
loses its real name, and assumes the more ungrateful form of obligation.
From hence we find, that those who regularly undertake to cultivate
friendship, find ingratitude generally repays their endeavours. That
circle of beings, which dependence gathers round us, is almost ever
unfriendly; they secretly wish the term of their connexions more nearly
equal; and, where they even have the most virtue, are prepared to
reserve all their affections for their patron, only in the hour of his
decline. Increasing the obligations which are laid upon such minds, only
increases their burthen; they feel themselves unable to repay the
immensity of their debt, and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent
resentment at the hand that is stretched out with offers of service and
relief.</p>

<p>Plautinus was a man who thought that every good was bought from
riches; and as he was possessed of great wealth, and had a mind
naturally formed for virtue, he resolved to gather a circle of the best
men round him. Among the number of his dependents was Musidorus, with a
mind just as fond of virtue, yet not less proud than his patron. His
circumstances, however, were such as forced him to stoop to the good
offices of his superior, and he saw himself daily among a number of
others loaded with benefits and protections of friendship. These, in the
usual course of the world, he thought it prudent to accept; but, while
he gave his esteem, he could not give his heart. A&nbsp;want of
affection breaks out in the most trifling instances, and Plautinus had
skill enough so observe the minutest actions of the man he wished to
make his friend. In these he ever found his aim disappointed; for
Musidorus claimed an exchange of hearts, which Plautinus, solicited by a
variety of claims, could never think of bestowing.</p>

<p>It may be easily supposed, that the reserve of our poor proud man,
was soon construed into ingratitude; and such, indeed, in the common
acceptation of the world it was. Wherever Musidorus appeared, he was
remarked as the ungrateful man; he had accepted favours, it was said,
and had still the insolence to pretend to independence. The event,
however, justified his conduct. Plautinus, by misplaced liberality, at
length became poor; and it was then that Musidorus first thought of
making a friend of him. He flew to the man of fallen fortune
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page199" id = "page199">199</a></span>
with an offer of all he had; wrought under his direction with assiduity;
and by uniting their talents, both were at length placed in that state
of life from which one of them had formerly fallen.</p>

<h4>NATURE.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">An</span> happy sensibility
to the beauties of Nature should be cherished in young persons. It
engages them to contemplate the Creator in his wonderful works; it
purifies and harmonizes the soul, and prepares it for moral and
intellectual discipline; it supplies an endless source of amusement; it
contributes even to bodily health; and as a strict analogy subsists
between material and mortal beauty, it leads the heart by an easy
transition from the one to the other; and thus recommends virtue for its
transcendent loveliness and makes vice appear the object of contempt and
abomination.</p>


<hr class = "article w33">

<h4>AFFECTION.</h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">From</span> the impassioned
feelings of the mother, to him who stands joyless on the verge of
apathy, the tide of affection flows in a long and devious course. Clear,
full and vehement, it descends into the vale of life, where, after a
short time, becoming tranquil and serene, it separates into many
branches; and these, again dividing, wander in a thousand streams,
dispensing, as they move along, the sweets of health and happiness. That
no felicity exists independent of a susceptibility for these emotions is
a certain fact; for to the heart of him who hath been cold to filial or
fraternal duty, the soothing charm of friendship and of love will ever
be unknown. It is therefore evident, that to be happy, man must
invariably consult the well being of others; to his fellow-creatures he
must attribute the bliss which he enjoys; it is a reward proportional to
the exertion of his philanthropy. Abstract the man of virtue and
benevolence from society, and you cut off the prime source of his
happiness; he has no proper object on which to place his affection, or
exercise his humanity; the sudden rapture of the grateful heart, the
tender tones of friendship, and the melting sweetness of expressive
love, no longer thrill upon his ear, or swell his softened soul; all is
an aching void, a&nbsp;cheerless and almost unproductive waste: yet even
in this situation, barren as it is, where none are found to pour the
balm of pity, or listen to the plaint of sorrow, even here some
enjoyment is derived from letting loose our affections upon inanimate
nature. “Where in a desert (says Sterne) I&nbsp;could not do better,
I&nbsp;would fasten them on some sweet myrtle, or seek some melancholy
cypress to connect myself to. I&nbsp;would court their shade, and greet
them kindly for their protection. I&nbsp;would cut my name upon them,
and swear they were the loveliest trees throughout the desert. If their
leaves withered, I&nbsp;would teach myself to mourn, and when they
rejoiced, I&nbsp;would rejoice with them.”</p>

<h4 class = "smallcaps">Lamentations Of Panthea Over The Body Of
Abradates.<a class = "plain" name = "tag201" id = "tag201" href =
"#note201">*</a></h4>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Be</span> the garland of
hope withered by the sigh of disappointment; be the lute of gladness no
more responsive to the fingers of melody. What hast thou to do with
dreams of rapture, with scenes of visionary transport, with the whispers
of fancy that mock the ear of attention? Thou hast nothing to do with
them. O&nbsp;ill-fated Panthea! thy peace, thy loves, thy joys are at an
end: the howl of calamity has chased thy slumbers of happiness, and
doomed sorrow and solitude to be thy hapless handmaids. How terrific is
the brow of anguish to the eye of complaisance! to the children of
festivity how convulsive is the cup of astonishment! My heart is as the
heart of a babe that weeps bitterly; I&nbsp;have all the weakness of
childhood, and all the sorrows of age. As the patient whose malady
scoffs at physic, I&nbsp;am hopeless without a cure, I&nbsp;am
disconsolate as the ghost of midnight among the tombs of my forefathers.
Why, O&nbsp;thou nurse of my infancy, didst thou reserve me to such a
date? why was I ever lulled upon the lap of tenderness? Would that ere
the dawning irradiations of reason I had died, in the morning of
existence thy Panthea had died; thou hadst wept over her urn with less
mortal anguish. But cease, O&nbsp;thou nurse of my infancy, for the
fault was not thine: thy imagination was enraptured with the fictions of
fondness, and painted fairer prospects for thy much-loved Panthea: thy
love reared around her the pavilions of ease, plucked the thorns of
adversity from the garden of pleasure, and perfumed her paths with the
incense of roses. It was not thine to descend to the recesses of
thought, and chase honour from its abode as the assassin of peace. It
was thy charm, O&nbsp;inhuman honour! that made captive my discretion,
and seduced me from the waters of consolation to the precipices of
despair. Why did I soar after thee on the wings of ambition, and spurn
at contentment for deriding thy deceit? My fancy thought thee fairer
than a studded diadem; more splendid than the gold in the waves of
Pactolus. Thou art fair, I&nbsp;said, and beautiful beyond the visions
of rapture; and the youth who holds my heart I will endeavour to possess
<span class = "pagenum">201b</span>
thee. I&nbsp;will enlarge upon thy glories that his soul may catch thy
fire; I&nbsp;will urge him to the plains of conquest; but, lo! he bleeds
beneath the spear.&mdash;Ye virgin daughters of Bactria, you have seen
the youth of my love: my love was foremost among the candidates for
honour, he was a hero without pre-eminence. His heart never fainted at
the clang of war; when the oriflamb of battle was erected in his view,
he stood strong as the gate of Susa, and immoveable as its battlements.
In the conflict he was dreadful as a host sheathed in terrors; rough and
terrible as a wave conflicting with the spirit of the blast. No force
dared oppose the burning flames of his wrath; he curbed the fury of the
sons of thunder in their midnight career, and waved the faulchion of
conquest over the heads of potentates. But when the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text unchanged: error for Paeans">Poeans</ins> of
victory have dismissed him from the plain, ye virgin daughters of
Bactria, you have seen him hasten to my arms, all placid as the smile of
virginity in the morning of youth; meek and gentle as a bride conducting
to the bowers of her bridegroom. When shall he exult at the voice of
fame above the shield of his might, and bear the wreath of glory from
his warring compeers? Alas! can the tear of evening resuscitate the
broken primrose of the vale, or shall the poplar once fallen grace the
banks of Zenderhoud; his shield of might is defenceless, his wreath of
glory is decayed, and the trumpet of fame has no music for his ear. Fool
that I was, why did I urge him to the fight? why did I arm his fortitude
against unequal slaughter! The burden of calamity presses heavy on my
soul<span class = "locked">---</span>my spirit faints within me<span

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Alumbrado</span> had spoken
the truth; the Duke found the Count in his apartment. The latter was at
first incapable of uttering a word, but having recovered from his
astonishment, he declined in a faltering accent to accept the invitation
of my friend. But when he heard the Duke talk of the guard, and saw that
he was a prisoner, he submitted to his fate. The Duke ordered his trunk
to be carried to his coach, and then drove with him to his palace.</p>

<p>Apprehending that the Count would be reserved in the presence of a
third person, he had previously requested me to retire with Alumbrado to
a closet, where we could hear and see them without being observed. The
introduction to their discourse had already been finished in the
carriage, consequently we heard only the continuation. As soon as they
had entered the room, the Duke desired the Count to give him the key of
his trunk, which was delivered to him without hesitation. While he was
opening the trunk and searching for papers which he could not find, the
Count took his letter-case out of his pocket and threw it in the chimney
fire.</p>

<p>Although the Duke hastened to save it, yet a great part of it had
already been consumed by the flames. The rest he locked up in his
writing desk.</p>

<p>“Why have you done this?” he said to the Count with rising anger.</p>

<p>“Because I do not like to have my secrets wrested from me by
force.”</p>

<p>The Duke took several turns in his apartment in order to recover his
equanimity, and then rung the bell. “Wine,” he called to the servant,
who brought it immediately and retired.</p>

<p>“Count,” said the Duke in a mild accent, “the wine possesses the
virtue of rendering people communicative and sincere. Let us drink.”</p>

<p>“You shall draw my secrets from me neither by force nor artifice.
I&nbsp;shall at least have the merit of confessing voluntarily, what I
can, and dare <ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing">confess.</ins>”</p>

<p>“Very well. However, wine possesses also the virtue of dispelling
animosity and perplexity. Come, let us drink<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>The Count consented to it.</p>

<p>“First of all,” said the Duke, after they had been seated, “tell me
where is Hiermanfor? He promised to pay me a visit as soon as Por***al
should be delivered from the Spa**sh yoke, but has not been as good as
his word.”</p>

<p>“He could not. Affairs of the greatest importance have called him to
Brasil, where he very probably is at present.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that he will fulfil his promise after his return<ins
class = "correction" title = "text has .">”?&nbsp;</ins></p>

<span class = "pagenum">202b</span>
<p>“Undoubtedly! but why do you wish for his visit<ins class =
"correction" title = "text has .">”?&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“He has promised to initiate me in the mysteries of an occult
philosophy. You are perhaps capable of supplying his place.”</p>

<p>“No, my Lord.”</p>

<p>“But you will be able to afford me some information with respect to
those illusions by which I have been put to the test?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” the Count replied, after a pause.</p>

<p>“I only desire you to explain to me the more intricate and most
important deceptions, for the rest I hope to unfold without your
assistance.”</p>

<p>“Most of them you have already discovered by the papers which you
have ta<span class = "locked">---</span> found in my trunk.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” The Duke asked with astonishment.</p>

<p>“I know it from Hiermanfor.”</p>

<p>“And by whom has <i>he</i> been informed of it?”</p>

<p>“By your Grace.”</p>

<p>“By me? I do not recollect to have discovered to him any thing.”</p>

<p>“Not directly; however, you have betrayed yourself.”</p>

<p>“On what occasion?”</p>

<p>“When he paid you a visit at **ubia. Do you not recollect to have
asked him whether he had discovered to Amelia that your real father had
not been the murderer of her Lord? This you could not have known if you
had not seen my papers.”</p>

<p>“It is true<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has .">”,&nbsp;</ins>the Duke replied after a short silence, “however, those
papers did not extend farther than to the time when Hiermanfor was taken
up in your and my tutor’s presence. I&nbsp;was then going to descend
into the subterraneous vaults of a ruinous building, in order to take a
brilliant pin out of the hair of a sleeping virgin.”</p>

<p>“I know it; but you would have found neither the sleeping virgin nor
any of those things which Hiermanfor told you you would meet with.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible; should he have risked a fraud in which I so easily
could have found him out?”</p>

<p>“He knew before-hand that you would not get to the bottom of the
staircase, for it was settled previously that I should appear in time
with the officers of the police, and recall your Grace by firing a
pistol.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the Duke with astonishment, “now I recollect another
very strange incident. I&nbsp;should perhaps not have descended without
your interference, for I was seized with an uncommon anxiety, which
increased every step I proceeded. I&nbsp;cannot conceive what was the
reason of it; however it seemed as if an invisible power pushed me
back.”</p>

<p>“This I will explain to you. Don’t you recollect that a thick smoke
ascended from the abyss? A&nbsp;stupifying incense which possessed the
power of straitening the breast, and creating anxiety, was burning at
the bottom of the stair-case.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page203" id = "page203">203</a></span>
<p>“I cannot but confess,” the Duke said, after a short pause, “that the
execution was not less cautious than the plan has been artful.
I&nbsp;had indeed been impelled, at that time, to believe Hiermanfor was
not only possessed of the knowledge of subterraneous treasures, but also
of the power and the inclination of affording me a share of them, and
that it had been merely my fault to have returned empty handed. His
cursory account of the wonderful things I should meet with in the abyss
had contributed to set my imagination at work, and I was more desirous
to see those miraculous things, than to get possession of the
jewels.”</p>

<p>“Your Grace resented it very much that I had interrupted that
adventure by the seizure of Hiermanfor.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I did, but what view had you in doing it?”</p>

<p>“It was of great consequence to me, to prove myself to you and your
tutor, in an incontestible manner, an implacable enemy of Hiermanfor.
How could I have effected it better than by seizing him? the magistrate
was an intimate friend of mine, and the whole farce pre-concerted with
him.”</p>

<p>“Then the Irishman has not been taken up seriously?”</p>

<p>“The officers of the police had been ordered to set him at liberty as
soon as he should be out of your sight.”</p>

<p>“Now I can comprehend why you so obstinately opposed me when I
intreated my tutor to make an attempt at delivering Hiermanfor.<span
class = "locked">----</span>But what would you have done, if I had
persisted in my resolution of taking that step?”</p>

<p>“Then you should certainly not have done it alone; I would have
accompanied you to the magistrate, who undoubtedly would have found
means of consoling you with respect to Hiermanfor’s fate. It seemed,
nevertheless, not to be advisable to suffer you to remain any longer in
the neighbourhood of the theatre where that scene had been performed.
You might have peeped behind the curtain without our knowledge, and your
tutor could have made secret enquiries. An accident might easily have
betrayed to you that the process against Hiermanfor was a fiction; in
short, we could not have acted with safety and liberty while you should
have been near the scene of action, and for that reason the magistrate
was suborned to endeavour to persuade you to a speedy flight, in which
he succeeded to our greatest satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Now it is evident how Hiermanfor could shew so much tranquility and
unconcern when he was taken up, how he could promise to see me at **n,
and make good his promise.”</p>

<p>“The latter was indeed an easy matter; however he wanted to render
his re-appearance interesting by concomitant extraordinary
circumstances. A&nbsp;lamentable incident procured him the means of
effecting his purpose. You will recollect the execution of Franciska,
the too late discovery of her innocence, and the nocturnal funeral to
which I invited you.<span class = "locked">---</span>Hiermanfor could
not have re-appeared to you on a more remarkable opportunity. At that
period, when your soul was thrilled with gloomy melancholy and chilling
sensations, the sight of a man whom you supposed to languish in
<span class = "pagenum">203b</span>
a dungeon, or perhaps to have finished already his career on the stake,
could not but make the deepest impression on you. You know that he
omitted nothing that promised to enforce that impression.”</p>

<p>“But how could he then already know that I had been raised to the
ducal dignity?”</p>

<p>“He had received early intelligence of it by a letter from a friend,
who was intimate with the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘secretar’ at line-end">secretary</ins> of your father.”</p>

<p>“Let us drop the discourse on the scene of that night, it is
accompanied with too horrid and painful ideas. Let us repair to the
retired cell of the royal hermit, where no inferior miracles are
crowding upon us. First of all, tell me whether you really think him to
be the old banished King?”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed, not only because Hiermanfor has told me so, but also
because his whole form resembles in a most striking manner, the picture
of the real King.”</p>

<p>“But when do you think he will ascend the throne of Port**al?”</p>

<p>“I suppose, very soon!”</p>

<p>“Do you, indeed? I can see, as yet, no preparations for it. They even
do not <i>talk</i> of the old King; every one believes him to be dead;
I&nbsp;think it would be time to spread the news of his being still
alive.”</p>

<p>“I must confess that I have neither heard nor seen any thing of him
since we left him in his cell. I&nbsp;hope Hiermanfor’s return will be
the period of his taking possession of the throne. Perhaps he intends to
introduce him in triumph in Port**al.”</p>

<p>“It seems, at least, that they are very intimately connected. Do you
recollect how Hiermanfor appeared at night, in a manner equally
mysterious and surprizing, when he was summoned by the royal
Hermit?”</p>

<p>“O! as for that juggling trick<span class = "locked">---</span>”</p>

<p>The Duke started from his chair. “A juggling trick---this too should
have been a juggling trick?”</p>

<p>“How can you be surprized at this discovery?”</p>

<p>“The incident was indeed wonderful enough for giving reason to think
it supernatural.”</p>

<p>“You are right. That artifice could not but produce an astonishing
effect on an uninformed spectator. The Hermit pronounces some
unintelligible words while he kisses the picture three times; the lamp
is extinguished and lighted again, as if it were by an invisible hand;
a&nbsp;sudden noise is heard, and a flame flashes over the picture. All
this is very surprising. However, if one knows that the altar, on which
the picture is placed, conceals a machine, that the Hermit’s finger
touches a secret spring, and this puts the wheels of the machine in
motion, that the wick in the lamp is connected with it, and pulled down
and up again through the tube in which it is fixed; if one knows
<i>how</i> Hiermanfor entered the cell, then the whole incident will be
divested of its supernatural appearance<ins class = "correction" title =

<p>“But this very appearance of Hiermanfor is entirely mysterious
to&nbsp;me.”</p>

<h4>THE STORY OF ALCANDER AND SEPTIMIUS.</h4>

<p class = "center smallest">TAKEN FROM A BYZANTINE HISTORIAN.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Athens</span>, long after
the decline of the Roman empire, still continued the seat of learning,
politeness, and wisdom. Theodoric, the Ostrogoth, repaired the schools
which barbarity was suffering to fall into decay, and continued those
pensions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had
monopolized.</p>

<p>In this city, and about this period, Alcander and Septimius were
fellow students together; the one, the most subtle reasoner of all the
Lyceum; the other, the most eloquent speaker in the academic grove.
Mutual admiration soon begot friendship. Their fortunes were nearly
equal, and they were natives of the two most celebrated cities in the
world; for Alcander was of Athens, Septimius came from Rome.</p>

<p>In this state of harmony they lived for some time together, when
Alcander, after passing the first part of his youth in the indolence of
philosophy, thought at length of entering into the busy world; and, as a
step previous to this, placed his affections on Hypatia, a&nbsp;lady of
exquisite beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the
previous ceremonies were performed; and nothing now remained but her
being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended
bridegroom.</p>

<p>Alcander’s exultation in his own happiness, or being unable to enjoy
any satisfaction without making his friend Septimius a partner,
prevailed upon him to introduce Hypatia to his fellow-student; which he
did with all the gaiety of a man who found himself equally happy in
friendship and love. But this was an interview fatal to the future peace
of both; for Septimius no sooner saw her, but he was smitten with an
involuntary passion; and, though he used every effort to suppress
desires at once so imprudent and unjust, the emotions of his mind in a
short time became so strong, that they brought on a fever, which the
physicians judged incurable.</p>

<p>During this illness, Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of
fondness, and brought his mistress to join in those amiable offices of
friendship. The sagacity of the physicians, by these means, soon
discovered that the cause of their patient’s disorder was love; and
Alcander being apprised of their discovery, at length extorted a
confession from the reluctant dying lover.</p>

<p>It would but delay the narrative to describe the conflict between
love and friendship in the breast of Alcander on this occasion; it is
enough to say, that the Athenians were at that time arrived at such
refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to excess. In short,
forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her
charms, to the young Roman. They were married privately by his
connivance, and this unlooked for change of fortune wrought as
unexpected a change in the constitution of the now happy Septimius. In a
few days he was perfectly recovered, and set out with his fair partner
for Rome. Here, by an exertion of those talents which he was so
eminently possessed of, Septimius, in a few
<span class = "pagenum">204b</span>
years, arrived at the highest dignities of the state, and was
constituted the city judge, or prætor.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Alcander not only felt the pain of being separated
from his friend and his mistress, but a prosecution was also commenced
against him, by the relations of Hypatia, for having basely given up his
bride, as was suggested, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to
his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to
withstand the influence of a powerful party. He was cast, and condemned
to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to raise so large a sum
at the time appointed, his possessions were confiscated, he himself was
stripped of the habit of freedom, exposed as a slave in the
market-place, and sold to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>A merchant of Thrace becoming his purchaser, Alcander, with some
other companions of distress, was carried into that region of desolation
and sterility. His stated employment was to follow the herds of an
imperious master, and his success in hunting was all that was allowed
him so supply his precarious subsistence. Every morning waked him to a
renewal of famine or toil, and every change of season served but to
aggravate his unsheltered distress. After some years of bondage,
however, an opportunity of escaping offered; he embraced it with ardour;
so that, travelling by night, and lodging in caverns by day, to shorten
a long story, he at last arrived in Rome. The same day on which Alcander
arrived, Septimius sat administering justice in the forum, whither our
wanderer came, expecting to be instantly known, and publicly
acknowledged, by his former friend. Here he stood the whole day amongst
the crowd, watching the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken
notice of; but he was so much altered by a long succession of hardships,
that he continued unnoticed among the rest; and, in the evening, when he
was going up to the prætor’s chair, he was brutally repulsed by the
attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from
one ungrateful object to another; for night coming on, he now found
himself under the necessity of seeking a place to lie in, and yet knew
not where to apply. All emaciated and in rags, as he was, none of the
citizens would harbour so much wretchedness; and sleeping in the streets
might be attended with interruption or danger: in short, he was obliged
to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city, the usual
retreat of guilt, poverty, and despair. In this mansion of horror,
laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his miseries for a while
in sleep; and found, on his flinty couch, more ease than beds of down
can supply to the guilty.</p>

<p>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this
their retreat; but, happening to disagree about the division of their
plunder, one of them stabbed the other to the heart, and left him
weltering in blood at the entrance. In these circumstances he was found
next morning, dead, at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a
further enquiry, an alarm was spread; the cave was examined, and
Alcander being
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page205" id = "page205">205</a></span>
found, was immediately apprehended, and accused of robbery and murder.
The circumstances against him were strong, and the wretchedness of his
appearance confirmed suspicion. Misfortune and he were now so long
acquainted, that he at last became regardless of life. He detested a
world where he had found only ingratitude, falsehood, and cruelty; he
was determined to make no defence; and thus, lowering with resolution,
he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribunal of Septimius. As
the proofs were positive against him, and he offered nothing in his own
vindication, the judge was proceeding to doom him to a most cruel and
ignominious death, when the attention of the multitude was soon divided
by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was
apprehended selling his plunder, and, struck with a panic, had confessed
his crime. He was brought bound to the same tribunal, and acquitted
every other person of any partnership in his guilt. Alcander’s innocence
therefore appeared, but the sullen rashness of his conduct remained a
wonder to the surrounding multitude; but their astonishment was still
further increased, when they saw their judge start from his tribunal to
embrace the supposed criminal. Septimius recollected his friend and
former benefactor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy.
Need the sequel be related? Alcander was acquitted; shared the
friendship and honours of the principal citizens of Rome; lived
afterwards in happiness and ease; and left it to be engraved on his
tomb, That no circumstances are so desperate, which Providence may not
relieve.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">205b</span>
<p>These desperate reflections at length determined my conduct, and I no
longer examined whether or not, in removing at a distance from my
waggon, I&nbsp;was in danger of never finding it again. To carry some
provisions to my father-in-law and wife, to succour Pulaski and
Lodoiska<span class = "locked">---</span>these were now the only
sentiments that occupied my mind.</p>

<p>I accordingly seize my fowling-piece, take some powder and shot, and
load one of my horses with necessaries: I&nbsp;pierce into the woods
much farther than during the former evening; I&nbsp;again hollow with
all my strength; I&nbsp;again make frequent discharges with my gun. The
most melancholy silence reigned all around&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>I now find myself in a part of the forest where the trees were so
extremely thick, that there was no longer any passage for my horse: I,
therefore, tie him to a tree, and my despair getting the better of every
other consideration, I&nbsp;still continue to advance with my gun, and
part of my provisions. I&nbsp;had now wandered about for two hours more,
my inquietude forcing me every moment to redouble my pace, when at
length I perceive human footsteps imprinted on the snow.</p>

<p>Hope gives me new strength, and I therefore instantly follow the
traces which were still fresh. Soon after I discover Pulaski almost
naked, emaciated with hunger, and so changed as scarce to be known even
by&nbsp;me!</p>

<p>He makes all the efforts in his power to drag his limbs towards me,
and to reply to my enquiries. The moment that I had rejoined him, he
seizes, with avidity, on the victuals that I present to him, and devours
them in an instant. I&nbsp;then demand of him where
Lodoiska&nbsp;is.</p>

<p>“Alas!” says he, “you will see her there!” The tone of voice in which
he pronounced these words made me tremble. I&nbsp;run to, I&nbsp;arrive
at, the cavern, but too well prepared for the melancholy spectacle that
awaited me. Lodoiska, wrapped up in her own clothes, and covered with
those of her father, was extended upon a bed of half rotten leaves!</p>

<p>She raises, with some difficulty, her weary head, and refusing the
aliments which I now offer her, addresses me as follows:<span class =

<p>Pulaski, whose courage never abandoned him, and whose strength was by
this time restored, obliges me to occupy myself jointly with him, in the
business of procuring our subsistence.</p>

<p>By following along the snow the prints of my footsteps, we arrive at
length at the place where I had left my waggon, which we immediately
unload, and burn soon after, on purpose to withhold from our enemies the
most distant suspicion of the place of our retreat.</p>

<p>By the aid of our horses, for which we procure a passage, by making a
circuitous journey, instead of attempting to bring them straight to the
place of our retreat, we were at length able to transport those
provisions and moveables to our cavern, which it was so necessary for us
to procure, and to husband, if we resolved to remain much longer in this
solitude. We soon after killed our horses, which we were unable to
supply with food. We lived upon their flesh, which the rigour of the
season preserved for a considerable time; it corrupted, however, at
length; and our fire-arms being unable to procure us any other than a
scanty supply of game, we were obliged to have recourse to our
provisions; which at the end of three months, were entirely
consumed.</p>

<p>Some gold, and the greater part of Lodoiska’s diamonds still
remained. Should I make a second voyage to Pultava? Or should we both
run the hazard of such an undertaking, and quit our retreat in company?
We had already suffered so much, and so cruelly in this forest, that we
resolved to embrace the latter resolution.</p>

<p>We accordingly sally forth; we pass the Sem near Rylks; we purchase a
boat there, and, disguising ourselves in the dress of fishermen, we
descend that river, and enter the Desna.</p>

<p>Our boat was visited at Czernicove, but misery had so disfigured
Pulaski, that it was impossible any longer to recognize him. We then
enter the Dnieper; we cross from Kiof<a class = "plain" name = "tag206a"
id = "tag206a" href = "#note206a">*</a> to Krylow. There we were obliged
to receive into our boat, and carry to the other side, several Russian
soldiers who were on their march to join a small army employed against
Pugatchew.</p>

<p>At Zoporiskaia we heard of the capture of Bender and Oczakow, the
conquest of the Crimea, the defeat and subsequent death of the Vizir
Oglou.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">206b</span>
<p>Pulaski, reduced to a state of desperation, was anxious to traverse
the vast deserts that separated him from Pugatchew, on purpose to join
himself to that enemy of the Russians; but the excess of our fatigues
obliged us to remain at Zaporiskaia.</p>

<p>The peace, which was soon after concluded between Russia and the
Porte, at length afforded us the means of entering Turkey.</p>

<p>On foot, and still disguised, we crossed the Boudziac, part of
Moldavia and Wallachia, and after a thousand unforeseen and unexpected
difficulties and fatigues, we at length arrive at Adrianople.</p>

<p>Having remained for some time at this place, on purpose to repair our
exhausted forces, we prepare to depart: but we are arrested, and being
carried before the Cadi, are accused of having sold several diamonds in
the course of our journey, which we had apparently stolen. The miserable
clothes with which we were covered, had given rise to this
suspicion.</p>

<p>Pulaski discovers himself to the mussulman judge, and he sends us
immediately to Constantinople.</p>

<p>We are admitted shortly after to an audience of the grand signior. He
orders apartments to be prepared for us, and assigns us a liberal
pension upon his treasury.</p>

<p>I then write to my sisters, and to Boleslas: we learn, by their
answers, that all the property of Pulaski had been confiscated, that he
was degraded from his rank, and condemned to lose his head.</p>

<p>My father-in-law is in the utmost consternation on receiving this
intelligence: he is filled with indignation at being accused as a
regicide: he writes home in his own justification.</p>

<p>Constantly animated, and devoured as it were with the love of his
country, continually influenced by the mortal hatred which he had sworn
against its enemies, he never ceased, during the four whole years that
we remained in Turkey, to endeavour, by his intrigues, to oblige the
Porte to declare war against Russia.</p>

<p>In 1774, amidst a transport of rage, he receives intelligence of the
triple invasion,<a class = "tag" name = "tag206b" id = "tag206b" href =
"#note206b">†</a> which bereaved the republic of one third of its
possessions.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1776, that the patriots of America, fearful
of the tyranny of an island which once boasted of its own liberties,
resolved to redeem their violated rights by force of arms. My country
hath lost her freedom, says Pulaski to me one day: but, ah, let us still
fight for that of a new people!</p>

<p>We pass into Spain, we embark on board a vessel bound for the
Havannah, from whence we repair to Philadelphia. The congress instantly
presents us with commissions, and employs us in the army of General
Washington.</p>

<h4>EXTRAORDINARY RECOMPENCE ACCORDED TO MERIT.</h4>

News-paper of the 17th of last October, the following paragraph is

<p>When it is considered that previous to the publication of a work, it
always undergoes the investigation of the person to whom it is
dedicated, it must be obvious that from the extraordinary merits of this
performance alone, the Queen could be induced to make so liberal a
display of approbation. Indeed, when the style, language, and general
object of the work is considered, no one will envy the writer the just
meed deservedly due to so inimitable a piece of composition. In this
work, the astonishing variety of characters, admirably supported,
discover a genius in the writer rarely to be met with. The reader is by
turns moved to tears, paled by apprehension, joyful at fortunate events,
or merry by the most ludicrous representations. Every passion is wrought
upon, every feeling is aroused to the most exquisite sensations. Vice
and wickedness do not alone undergo the lash of her pen, folly, levity,
thoughtlessness, inattention, and a numerous train of what are generally
termed venial improprieties are represented in their true and baneful
colours. The ills arising from these errors are often fatal; here youth,
in a picture drawn in the most masterly manner, are taught to avoid
those quicksands, on which the best constructed hearts have been too
often wrecked.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">Every</span> day’s
experience must convince the man of observation, that our happiness
depends upon the cultivation of our social duties, upon the nurture of
humanity and benevolence; that our crimes often proceed from the want of
domestic harmony, and that the flagitious deeds which glare upon us with
so horrid an aspect, are generally the consequences of a deviation from
the still small voice of duty and of love. He, who has been accustomed
to despise the feelings of the son, the husband, and the friend, will
not often be found proof again all the allurements of interest and of
vice. He, who (unless driven by hunger and despair) lifts up his daring
arm to arrest the property or the life of his fellow-creature, never
felt those soft sensations which arise from the consciousness of being
beloved; for let no man be called wretched who has this in reserve, let
no man be called poor who has a friend to consult.</p>

<h4>THE NETTLE AND THE ROSE:</h4>

<p class = "center smallest">AN ESSAY.</p>

<div class = "verse smaller">
<p>Our bane and physic the same earth bestows,</p>
<p>And near the noisome nettle blooms the rose.</p>
</div>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">We</span> may consider
human life as a garden, in which Roses and Nettles are promiscuously
scattered, and in which we as often feel the sting of the wounding
Nettle, as we enjoy the fragrance of the blooming Rose. Those bowers of
delight, entwined with the woodbine and jessamine, under whose friendly
umbrage we seek shelter from the noon-day sun, sometimes are the abode
of snakes, adders, and other venomous creatures, which wound us in those
unguarded scenes of delight. As the year has its seasons, and winter and
summer are constantly in pursuit of each other, so changeable likewise
is the condition of mortals; and as the elements are frequently
disturbed by storms, hurricanes, and tempests, so is the mind of man
frequently ruffled and discomposed, till the sunshine of reason and
philosophy bursts forth and dispels the gloom. Murmering brooks, purling
streams, and sequestered groves, whatever the fictions of a poetical
imagination may have advanced, are not always the seat of unmingled
pleasure, nor the abode of uninterrupted happiness.</p>

<p>The hapless Florio pined away some months on the delightful banks of
the Severn: he complained of the cruelty of the lovely Annabella, and
told his fond tale to the waters of that impetuous stream, which hurried
along regardless of his plaints. He gathered the lilies of the field:
but the lilies were not so fair as his Annabella, nor the fragrance of
the blushing rose so sweet as her breath; the lambs were not so
innocent, nor the sound of the tabour on the green half so melodious as
her voice. Time, however, has joined Florio and Annabella in the fetters
of wedlock, and the plaints of the swain are now changed. The delusion
of the enchantment is now vanished, and what he but lately considered as
the only object worthy of his sublunary pursuit, he now contemplates
with coolness, indifference, and disgust: enjoyment has metamorphosed
the Rose into a Nettle.</p>

<p>Ernestus, contrary to his inclination, was compelled by his parents
to marry the amiable Clara, whose sense,
<span class = "pagenum">209b</span>
tenderness, and virtues, soon fixed the heart of the roving Ernestus;
and what at first gave him pain and disgust, by degrees became familiar,
pleasing, and delightful: the Nettle was here changed to the Rose.</p>

<p>The wandering libertine, who pursues the Rose thro’ the unlawful
paths of love, who tramples under foot every tender plant that comes
within his reach, and who roves from flower to flower, like the bee,
only to rob it of its sweets, will at last lose his way, and, when
benighted, be compelled to repose on the restless bed of wounding
Nettles.</p>

<p>The blooming Rose is an utter stranger to the wilds of ambition,
where gloomy clouds perpetually obscure the beams of the joyful sun,
where the gentle zephyrs never waft thro’ the groves, but discordant
blasts are perpetually howling, and where the climate produces only
Thorns and Nettles.</p>

<p>The Rose reaches its highest perfection in the garden of industry,
where the soil is neither too luxuriant, nor too much impoverished.
Temperance fans it with the gentlest zephyrs, and health and contentment
sport around it. Here the Nettle no sooner makes its appearance, than
the watchful eye of prudence espies it, and, though it may not be
possible totally to eradicate it, it is never suffered to reach to any
height of perfection.</p>

<p>Since then human life is but a garden, in which weeds and flowers
promiscuously shoot up and thrive, let us do what we can to encourage
the culture of the Rose, and guard against the spreading Nettle. However
barren may be the soil that falls to our lot, yet a careful and
assiduous culture will contribute not a little to make the garden, at
least, pleasing and cheerful.</p>

<h4>DISINTERESTED ACTION.</h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">A disinterested</span> action, if it be not

merely indifferent, when not repugnant to a better method of disposing
of our superfluities; but they become vicious when they obstruct or
exhaust our abilities from a more virtuous disposition of our
circumstances.</p>

<p class = "first"><span class = "firstword">“And</span> yet it has been
affected in a very simple manner. A&nbsp;moveable board, which could be
pushed to and fro without the least noise, was concealed among those of
which the cell was composed. Hiermanfor stole through that hidden avenue
as soon as he saw from without, through a small hole, the lamp
extinguished. He could enter without the least danger of detection,
because you have turned your back towards him, and fixed your attention
entirely on the altar.”</p>

<p>“Then every thing had been previously prepared and pre-concerted with
the King?”</p>

<p>“Certainly!”</p>

<p>“And the whole conduct of the King has been regulated by
Hiermanfor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my Lord.”</p>

<p>“The incident,” the Duke replied, after a pause, “now ceases, indeed,
to appear miraculous to me; however, the behaviour of the king seems to
me so much the more mysterious. How is it possible that this reverend
old man could consent to deceive me in so degrading a manner?”</p>

<p>“It was no easy task to perswade him to it. However, after Hiermanfor
had exhorted his eloquence in vain, he declared at length proudly, that
no other choice was left him, than either leaving his crown forever in
the possession of an usurper, or to consent to that innocent artifice.
The King thought he was bound to choose the latter, for the benefit of
the empire and his private happiness.”</p>

<p>A long silence on both sides. At length the Duke resumed: “Hiermanfor
showed me the ghost of my tutor at the church-yard; by what means has
that been effected?”</p>

<p>“Your Grace will allow me to leave this question unanswered!”</p>

<p>“For what reason?” the Duke asked with seeming coolness.</p>

<p>“Because my answer would explain nothing to you.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think so? the explanations which you have given me, as
yet, have been very satisfactory to&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“They concerned only things which you were able to comprehend.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! you pay me a very bad compliment!”</p>

<p>“My Lord, do not misunderstand me, you have been telling me a little
while ago, that you have not yet been initiated by Hiermanfor in the
last mysteries of his philosophy!”</p>

<p>“I did, but what follows thence?”</p>

<p>“That you are still in want of the knowledge which will be requisite,
if you are to be capable of comprehending the appearance of your
tutor.”</p>

<p>“Don’t pretend to persuade me that this apparition has been effected
by supernatural means.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">210b</span>
<p>“I will persuade you to nothing, I only tell you what I know.”</p>

<p>“And I tell you only what I do not believe. All the other incidents
should have been effected by delusive arts, and Antonio’s appearance
only be excepted?”</p>

<p>“The appearance of <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘Antonia’">Antonio</ins> was no deception.”</p>

<p>“You will never make me believe it.”</p>

<p>“I cannot blame you for it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I have forfeited the right of deserving credit.”</p>

<p>The Duke was silent, viewing the Count attentively. The latter
resumed: “Besides, it is very indifferent to me what you think of the
matter. Hiermanfor may set you right.”</p>

<p>“How far are you connected with Hiermanfor?”</p>

<p>“Very much like you. He has made himself my master, and I am
subservient to him.”</p>

<p>“Do you serve him with reluctance?”</p>

<p>“With devotion.”</p>

<p>“Then you will know to whom you are devoted?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much more of him than your Grace.”</p>

<p>“Even that little which you know of him would be remarkable to me, if
authentic.”</p>

<p>“I should tire your patience if I were to repeat to you all the
improbable stories which are related of him. There are, however, very
few credible accounts of him.”</p>

<p>“I protest I should see glad to know them.”</p>

<p>“Even the true family name of Hiermanfor is not known to me. He is
said to have been born in Ireland, of plebeian parents. A&nbsp;near
relation who professed astrology, had observed the stars on his birth,
and prophesied great things of him. The same man persuaded his parents
to give him a learned education, which they afterwards repented so much
the less, when they perceived the astonishing progress in learning which
he made. When he had attained the years of adolescence, his relation
instructed him in mathematics and astronomy. The fame of Hiermanfor’s
great learning procured him the place of governor in a noble family. The
eldest daughter fell in love with him, and the language of her eyes soon
betrayed to him the impression he had made on her heart. She was a
blooming beauty, who had attracted by her uncommon charms, and rejected
many woers of high rank. It had been reserved for Hiermanfor to kindle
in her heart the first spark of love, and yet he appeared insensible of
his good fortune. But he was not. He entertained a high sense of the
preference given to him: honesty and prudence commanded him, however, to
conceal his sentiments for a person who was so far superior to him in
point of rank. Yet youthful age is not always capable of maintaining the
rigorous dictates of reason against the seducing voice of the passions,
and thus Hiermanfor betrayed, in an unguarded moment, the secret of his
heart, which was received with rapture by the young lady, and carefully
concealed in her bosom. But from that moment he resolved to endeavour to
rise to a situation which would permit him to woo the hand of his
mistress without
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page211" id = "page211">211</a></span>
blushing. This bold idea had no sooner taken place in the soul of the
resolute youth, than he began to delineate a plan for the execution of
it. Hiermanfor thought the naval service would be the shortest way of
attaining a splendid fortune, and instantly navigation became the chief
object of his study. He found very soon an opportunity of putting his
acquired knowledge in practice, which he chiefly owed to the support of
the family in which he had been tutor. The proofs of uncommon skill
which he gave in naval matters, soon raised him to the rank of a
captain, when his mistress died. Hiermanfor resigned his place in the
navy, and was received as <i>lay brother</i> in the order of the
Carmelites. Having performed his vow he was sent to Rome, where he got
acquainted with a priest of the same order, whose name was Father
Gabriel, and who was famed for his great skill in physic and natural
knowledge. Instructed by that learned man, he improved rapidly, and
acquired at the same time great knowledge in natural magic, in which his
relation had already instructed him.</p>

<p>“A genius like his could not, however, confine himself for a length
of time to cloistered retirement and a speculative life. His superiors
sent a mission to the Indies, and Hiermanfor got leave to make that
journey with the missionaries. There he is said to have acquired among
the Bramins the knowledge of the occult sciences, in the mysteries of
which he has promised to initiate your Grace. I&nbsp;do not know what
prompted him to leave the order afterwards. His superiors parting with
him reluctantly, rendered it very difficult for him to procure
dispensation from his vows. At length he got leave to retire, under the
condition never to be inimical to the order.<span class =
"locked">---</span>This is all that I know of his life.”</p>

<p>“Then every thing the Magistrate and the hermit have related of him
is a fictition?” the Duke enquired after a short silence.</p>

<p>“Not at all!” the Count replied, “almost all those accounts are
founded on facts, though they have been embellished by fictitious
episodes. The surprising feats of Hiermanfor, of which you have been
informed, were however effected merely by means of natural magic.”</p>

<p>“For instance, the delivery of the old King from the castle of St.
Lukar<span class = "locked">---</span>how has it been effected?”</p>

<p>“It certainly has been performed by Hiermanfor’s accuteness, though
not through him alone.”</p>

<p>“And the apparition of Antonio at the church-yard---”</p>

<p>“Has been effected by his supernatural power.”</p>

<p>“Count! by all that is dear to you, by Hiermanfor’s friendship, by
our reconciliation, what is your real opinion of that apparition?”</p>

<p>“That it was affected by his supernatural power!”</p>

<p>The Duke rose and pressed the Count’s hand. “Have you any secret wish
which I could satisfy? speak
<span class = "pagenum">211b</span>
freely, and I will satisfy it, cost it what it will, only make a frank
and candid confession.”</p>

<p>“I have confessed every thing already.”</p>

<p>“If you, perhaps, hesitate to discover your real sentiments here, you
may fix some other place, and I pledge my honour, that no man living
shall be made acquainted with your secret.”</p>

<p>“My dear Duke! I have indeed told you what I think.”</p>

<p>“Count, I conjure you, by every thing sacred, by the horrors of
eternity!” here the Duke encircled him with his arms, “by Amelia’s
spirit, tell we what do you think of that apparition?”</p>

<p>“I believe <i>that</i> apparition to have been effected by
Hiermanfor’s supernatural power,” replied the Count after a short
silence.</p>

<p>The Duke stepped a few paces back, and having viewed him some time
with a stern look, said, “You are my prisoner, do you know that I can
send you to the dungeon?”</p>

<p>“I am in your power.”</p>

<p>“Where you will not be entreated to speak the truth?”</p>

<p>“Even on the rack I shall not contradict what I have said.”</p>

<p>“Come,” said the Duke, after he had walked up and down the room in
silent meditation; “Come, I&nbsp;will give you some time for
consideration.”<span class = "locked">---</span>So saying, he led the
Count into another room where he locked him&nbsp;up.</p>

<p>“What shall I do with that fellow?” he said to me when he returned to
us, “believe what he has said and set him at liberty; or mistrust and
retain him?”</p>

<p>“Retain him,” my reply was: “if he sees that you are in earnest, he
certainly will confess.”</p>

the dread of incurring the expences incident to a married life with a
woman who had nothing, and now surely do I repent that I had not
generosity enough to overlook this consideration in favour of a charming
girl that I truly loved, and who wanted nothing but fortune to recommend
her. I&nbsp;was formerly clerk to her father, then a mechanic of great
respectability, but some years after greatly reduced by the unfortunate
turn of affairs in his business, incidents to many. When he failed,
I&nbsp;was settled in the world, and might have saved his amiable girl
from many a year of fatigue and distress into which their poverty
immersed them. But with <i>sang froid</i>, for which I now detest

title = "text has .">,&nbsp;</ins>for which I deemed the society of an elegant and
affectionate woman by no means an equivalent. Alas! I&nbsp;now see how I
miscalculated; how much such a partnership would have been for my
advantage in the long run. I&nbsp;now put the mutual participation of
pleasure and pain, the endearments of our children, that flattering
interest which Eliza would have taken in me (for whom by the way nobody
now cares a straw,) I&nbsp;put all these on the credit side of the
ledger, and find in the opposite page, only such a portion of expences
as I have actually brought upon myself, by being drawn in to give tavern
dinners, and a thousand other extravagancies that young men know not how
to avoid. You will easily see, when a just account is made out, what I
have gained, or rather what I have lost. Instead of the bright hearth
and smiling faces of my family, instead of sitting down in the midst of
beings who owe life to me, and portioning out their little meal with the
delicious sensations of a father, I&nbsp;take my solitary chop at a
coffee-house and afterwards saunter to the theatre, where venal beauty
spreads her net and I am caught! Alas! here is no mind, here is no
modesty to make sentiment interesting. After having seen a public
entertainment with Eliza, with what delight might we have passed the
remainder
<span class = "pagenum">213b</span>
of the evening. Her taste and sensibility would have made us live the
hours over again with additional pleasure. Her bosom would have been my
harbour in the storms of life, and there I should have found resources
from <i>ennui</i> in the calm season of prosperity. In the day of
sickness her voice could have whispered comfort, and in my dying hour
the pure invocations of my children might have availed me at the throne
of grace. What a sad reckoner have I been, I&nbsp;am now as grey as a
badger, and have not a single relative in the world. I&nbsp;have long
retired from business, but my fortune brings me no enjoyment, my dog
leads nearly as rational a life: I&nbsp;eat and drink and sleep
alternately as he does, for I now fear to become the prey of some
indigent dame, who would overlook my grey hairs and infirmities in
consideration of coming in for a third of my wealth, and therefore avoid
much commerce with the sex, from which, though I might once have derived
happiness, I&nbsp;can now only expect trick, or at best ridicule. But
what can a man do who has let avarice run away with him in his youth,
when all the social affections should have been at their out-posts to
prevent it? All that remains for such a man (after the example of a
culprit going to execution) is to warn the multitude how they fall into
this error. To assure them that the good which is not participated is
not half enjoyed, and that those who abandon a young woman from motives
like mine, as they do not deserve happiness so they never will obtain
it. And moreover, if you print this, pause to add, that an equal mixture
of love and prudence forms the only, and most delicious conserve they
will have the faculty of relishing all their life long. Either, taken
separately, is prejudicial; one being too austere, and the other too
sweet. They must be blended to render them happily effective, and if any
persons have skill enough to make up the composition after my recipe,

this proposition, and denying at once the influence of accident and
chance, to prove the power of man to accomplish his wishes in every
circumstance of situation and in every sphere of action. The partiality
of favours and the crash of unforeseen misfortune too often expose
neglected merit and ruined industry, as warning monitors in the road to
honour and to riches. While sudden unlooked for prosperity not
unfrequently demonstrates the best grounded fears of men unjustified by
events. But, however incompetent may be our power at all times to
acquire and confirm extraneous and adventitious greatness, or however
limited and erroneous our views of distant consequences in the common

Newton and Buffon, genius was defined only a superior degree of patience
and perseverence, and at the present day the advocates of this doctrine
are not inconsiderable either in numbers or in talents. True indeed it
is, that they incur no disgrace by entering the lists with many of their
opponents. On the subject of genius three distinct opinions appear to be
entertained. By some it is held to be an innate superiority of aptitude
to knowledge, independent of the labours of its possessor and
unsubjected to the influence of circumstance or situation. Others
rejecting altogether the idea of original difference in capacity,
ascribe it to the co-operation of accident and tuition confirming after
years of infancy a greater or less degree of comprehension. A&nbsp;third
set denying at once innate distinction and the agency of chance, give
all the credit to assiduity and allow to the mind no other wealth than
the requisitions of its industry. Of these opinions the first has long
been upon the decline, and the sentiments of the generality of
speculative men, are now divided between the second and the last. But on
which ever side of this question we enlist our conviction, we shall find
an investigation, that so much is owing to their own exertions as to
afford to the present demonstration sufficient for a moral proposition.
Pity that a truth so grateful to the friend of humanity, so encouraging
to the aspiring mind, should be so seldom and so feebly inculcated.

Ardent in pursuit, sanguine in expectation, with this impression what
obstacles would obstruct what difficulties dishearten the youthful
devotee of science. On the improvement of mind much has been written to
enlarge its stores and strengthen its capacity, many and different
methods have been recommended; but if want of attention to rules of
acknowledged necessity can warrant a repetition, a&nbsp;few hints on
this subject will need no excuse. In nothing probably are the generality
of men more deceived than in the opinion they form of the mental
progress of different individuals. To the lifeless soul whose diseased
eyes bespeak his labours over the midnight lamp&mdash;who, secluded from
society in the solitude of a study, loses his vivacity beneath a
ponderous load of immethodized undigested matter; duped by specious
appearance they give without examination the palm of learning. But in
the hour of exigence, when the intellectual host is summoned to the
field; when profit to ourselves and benefit to mankind stand the
criterions of useful acquisitions, then will it uniformly be proved that
reading well is infinitely better than reading much. In many who have
formed a taste for reading, that taste so productive of benefit and
delight; curiosity active and aspiring, still urging on even to flights
beyond its <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for stretch?">sketch</ins>, hurries attention over the field of view. The
different objects are but transiently inspected, and a mass of faint and
indistinct impressions are mixed in the brain, of which each in
succession makes the last less clear. With far less rapidity must he
travel who would explore with advantage the land of knowledge. Selecting
from the multitude of objects those most worthy of examination, he
should with persevering care investigate their principles and structure
and leave them not till satisfied he possesses all the information they
can give. To read as we ought, we must read with attention and with
thought. Many there are who read with attention, but few with thought.
Simply to comprehend the meaning and keep in mind the connection of an
author’s arguments is not sufficient, we must see and feel their force.
Never to take upon trust the sentiments of another, to examine with
minuteness his principles and his deductions, and to be assured of the
justness of the former and the accuracy of the latter, before he adopts
them as his own, should be the constant practice of him who would read
with real and permanent utility. In order to this, it is necessary to
form in youth a habit of deep severe persevering thought. To form this
habit is at first indeed difficult, nay painful. Inclined to <ins class
= "correction" title = ", missing">ease,</ins> the mind especially in
early life, averts from the labour of reflection; but when confirmed, it
finds in it a never ending treasure: every surrounding object affords it
employment; the man who possesses it discovers in the worlds of
sentiment, of manners, of science and of art, sources of continual
unbounded improvement. An eminent instance of this was the celebrated
Gibbon, “I&nbsp;have been led by a <ins class = "correction" title =

The Subscribers and Public in general are respectfully informed, that
<span class = "smallcaps">John Bull</span>, late Editor and Publisher of
this <span class = "smallcaps">Magazine</span>, has disposed of the
establishment to Mr. <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas Burling</span>,
Jun. from the 1st day of January, 1797. In committing this publication
to other hands J. Bull feels assured, that the talents which are in
future to be employed in conducting it, are such as cannot fail to
afford the fullest satisfaction to its patrons, and must ensure an
accession of that celebrity which it has hitherto enjoyed.</p>

<p>At the moment of relinquishing so arduous a task, the grateful
recollection of the steady support and kindnesses of my numerous friends
in this undertaking, demand the warmest thanks. To those who have
favoured me with the productions of their pens, I&nbsp;beg leave to
recommend my successor; and to entreat for him a continuance of that
friendship, the remembrance of which can never be effaced from my
mind.</p>

<p>In order fully to close the Accounts to this period, I must intreat,
that the bills for the small arrearages due to the 1st of January, 1797,
may be punctually honoured&mdash;each distinct sum is but trifling,
while the aggregate amounts to some hundred pounds; an exact compliance
will add to the obligations already heaped&nbsp;on</p>

Cherry-street. I&nbsp;have now in the press, publishing by subscription,

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> becoming the Editor of so
valuable a publication as The <span class = "smallcaps">New-York Weekly
Magazine</span>, I&nbsp;cannot but feel sensations of gratitude to its
generous patronizers for the liberal encouragement it has heretofore
been favoured with; without which, there would not have been so great a
stimulus to my undertaking this arduous task.</p>

<p>Sensibly feeling the duty that is incumbent on me in conducting this
<i>Repository of Literary and Useful Knowledge</i>, all the attention
and assiduous circumspection which is requisite to make it useful,
entertaining and edifying to every capacity, may be relied on by a
generous public.</p>

<p>It would be useless for me to enlarge upon the merits of a work which
has so long received the approbation of an enlightened
people.&mdash;Certain it is, that every attentive and candid reader will
confess, or at least acknowledge the utility of this production, as the
vehicle of refined ideas and engaging principles; contributing to
disseminate and establish the most virtuous sentiments, while it
stimulates to noble and generous actions.</p>

<p>I humbly solicit the literary abilities of those kind Correspondents
who have hitherto come forward in support of this publication; and,
shall always gratefully acknowledge the productions of the candid and
sentimental writer.</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p><b>Original</b>: <i>The life and adventures of the chevalier de
Faublas</i>, 1787, by Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvray. The Lovzinski
episode covers chapters VIII-XIV (to the end of the first volume in the
4-volume edition, or about 3/4 through the first in the 3-volume
edition).</p>
<p><b>English translation</b>: Exact source unknown. The serialized text
is identical to the 1811 edition, except for the spelling of the name
Pulaski&mdash;Pulauski in the book&mdash;and the “translator’s
afterword” in the serial.</p>
</div>

<div class = "hanging">
<p><b>Notes</b>: The passages with dots and asterisks seem to be
decorative, since they also occur in an early French edition.</p>
<p>The novel ends differently than what is implied in the magazine. The
daughter of Lovzinski and Lodoiska appears later in the book as a
secondary character.</p>

<p><b>Background</b>: A footnote in the novel says<br>
<i>The Translator thinks that he can venture to pronounce M.
P&mdash;&mdash; to be the nobleman who was formerly called Count
Poniatowski, and who at present so worthily fills the throne of
Poland.</i></p>

<p>Poniatowski abdicated in 1795, after the novel and its translation
were published, but before the New-York Weekly serialization. He was
kidnapped by the Bar Confederates in 1771, during the dramatic period of
the novel. The story conflates two Pulaskis, the father Joseph and the
son Casimir (“the” Pulaski to Americans).</p>
